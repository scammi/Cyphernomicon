 11.3. Surveillance and Privacy
   11.3.1. We've come a long way from Secretary of State Stimpson's
            famous "Gentlemen do not read other gentlemen's mail"
            statement. It is now widely taken for granted that Americans
            are to be monitored, surveilled, and even wiretapped by the
            various intelligence agencies. The FBI, the National Security
            Agency, the CIA, the National Reconnaissance Office, etc.
            (Yes, these groups have various charters telling them who
            they can spy on, what legalities they have to meet, etc. But
            they still spy. And there's not an uproar--the "What have you
            got to hide?" side of the American privacy dichotomy.)
   11.3.2. Duncan Frissell reminds us of Justice Jackson's 1948
            dissenting opinion in some case:
           - "The government could simplify criminal law enforcement by
              requiring every citizen "to keep a diary that would show
              where he was at all times, with whom he was, and what he
              was up to." [D.F. 1994-09-06, from an article in the WSJ]
           - (It should be noted that tracking devices--collars,
              bracelets, implantable transmitters--exist and are in use
              with prisoners. Some parents are even installing them in
              children, it is rumored. A worry for the future?)
   11.3.3. "What is the "surveillance state"?"
           - the issue with crypto is the _centralization_ of
              eavesdropping...much easier than planting bugs
           + "Should some freedom be given up for security?"
             + "Those who are willing to trade freedom for security
               - deserve neither
               + freedom nor security
                 - Ben Franklin
             - the tradeoff is often illusory--police states result when
                the trains are made to run on time
           - "It's a bit ironic that the Administration is crying foul
              so loudly
              over the Soviet/Russian spy in the CIA -- as if this was
              unfair --
              while they're openly proclaiming the right to spy on
              citizens
              and foreigners via Clipper." [Carl Ellison, 1994-02-23]
           + Cameras are becoming ubiquitous
             + cheap, integrated, new technologes
               - SDI fisheye lens
             - ATMs
             - traffic, speed traps, street corners
             - store security
           - Barcodes--worst fear of all...and not plausible
           + Automatic recognition is still lacking
             - getting better, slowly
             - neural nets, etc. (but these require training)
   11.3.4. "Why would the government monitor _my_ communications?"
           - "Because of economics and political stability....You can
              build computers and monitoring devices in secret, deploy
              them in secret, and listen to _everything_.  To listen to
              everything with bludgeons and pharmaceuticals would not
              only cost more in labor and equipment, but also engender a
              radicalizing backlash to an actual police state." [Eric
              Hughes, 1994-01-26]
           - Systems like Digital Telephony and Clipper make it much too
              easy for governments to routinely monitor their citizens,
              using automated technology that requires drastically less
              human involvement than previous police states required.
   11.3.5. "How much surveillance is actually being done today?"
           + FBI and Law Enforcement Surveillance Activities
             - the FBI kept records of meetings (between American
                companies and Nazi interests), and may have used these
                records during and after the war to pressure companies
           + NSA and Security Agency Surveillance Activities
             - collecting economic intelligence
             - in WW2, Economic Warfare Council (which was renamed Board
                of Economic Warfare) kept tabs on shipments of petroleum
                and other products
             + MINARET, code word for NSA "watch list" material
                (intercepts)
               - SIGINT OPERATION MINARET
               - originally, watch list material was "TOP SECRET
                  HANDLE VIA COMINT CHANNELS ONLY   UMBRA GAMMA"
               + NSA targeting is done primarily via a list called
                  Intelligence Guidelines for COMINT Priorities (IGCP)
                 - committe made up of representatives from several
                    intelligence agencies
                 - intiated in around 1966
             + revelations following Pentagon Papers that national
                security elsur had picked up private conversations (part
                of the Papers)
               - timing of PP was late 1963, early 1964...about time UB
                  was getting going
             + F-3, the NSA's main antenna system for intercepting ASCII
                transmissions from un-TEMPESTed terminals and PCs
               - signals can be picked up through walls up to a foot
                  thick (or more, considering how such impulses bounce
                  around)
           + Joint FBI/NSA Surveillance Activities
             + Operation Shamrock was a tie between NSA and FBI
               - since 1945, although there had been earlier intercepts,
                  too
               - COINTELPRO, dissidents, radicals
               + 8/0/45 Operation Shamrock begins
                 - a sub rosa effort to continue the monitoring
                    arrangements of WW II
                 - ITT Communications agreed to turn over all cables
                 + RCA Communications also turned over all cables
                   - even had an ex-Signal Corps officer as a VP to
                      handle the details
                   - direct hookups to RCA lines were made, for careful
                      monitoring by the ASA
                   - cables to and from corporations, law firms,
                      embassies, citizens were all kept
                   + 12/16/47   Meeting between Sosthenes Behn of ITT,
                      General Ingles of RCA, and Sec. of Defense James
                      Forrestal
                     - to discuss Operation Shamrock
                     - to arrange exemptions from prosecution
               + 0/0/63   Operation Shamrock enters a new phase as RCA
                  Global switches to computerized operation
                 - coincident with Harvest at NSA
                 - and perfect for start of UB/Severn operations
               + 1/6/67   Hoover officially terminates "black bag"
                  operations
                 - concerned about blowback
                 - had previously helped NSA by stealing codes, ciphers,
                    decrypted traffic, planting bugs on phone lines, etc.
                 - from embassies, corporations
                 - unclear as to whether these operations continued
                    anyway
                 + Plot Twist: may have been the motivation for NSA and
                    UB/Severn to pursue other avenues, such as the use of
                    criminals as cutouts
                   - and is parallel to "Plumbers Unit" used by  White
                      House
               + 10/1/73   AG Elliot Richardson orders FBI and SS to
                  stop requesting NSA surveillance material
                 - NSA agreed to stop providing this, but didn't tell
                    Richardson about Shamrock or Minaret
                 - however, events of this year (1973) marked the end of
                    Minaret
               + 3/4/77   Justice Dept. recommends against prosecution
                  of any NSA or FBI personnel over Operations Shamrock
                  and Minaret
                 - decided that NSCID No. 9 (aka No. 6) gave NSA
                    sufficient leeway
               - 5/15/75   Operation Shamrock officially terminated
               - and Minaret, of course
             + Operation Shamrock-Details
               + 8/0/45 Operation Shamrock begins
                 - a sub rosa effort to continue the monitoring
                    arrangements of WW II
                 - ITT Communications agreed to turn over all cables
                 + RCA Communications also turned over all cables

                 - coincident with Harvest at NSA
                 - and perfect for start of UB/Severn operations
               + 8/18/66   (Thursday)  New analysis site in New York for
                  Operation Shamrock
                 + Louis Tordella meets with CIA Dep. Dir. of Plans and
                    arranges to set up a new listening post for analysis
                    of the tapes from RCA and ITT (that had been being
                    shipped to NSA and then back)
                   - Tordella was later involved in setting up the watch
                      list in 1970 for the BNDD, (Operation Minaret)
                 - LPMEDLEY was code name, of a television tape
                    processing shop (reminiscent of "Man from U.N.C.L.E."
                 - but NSA had too move away later
               - 5/15/75   Operation Shamrock officially terminated
               + 10/1/73   AG Elliot Richardson orders FBI and SS to

                    Minaret
               - Abzug committee prompted by New York Daily News report,
                  7/22/75, that NSA and FBI had been monitoring
                  commercial cable traffic (Operation Shamrock)
               + 6/30/76    175 page report on Justice Dept.

               + 3/4/77   Justice Dept. recommends against prosecution
                  of any NSA or FBI personnel over Operations Shamrock
                  and Minaret
                 - decided that NSCID No. 9 (aka No. 6) gave NSA
                    sufficient leeway
               + the NSA program, begun in August 1945, to monitor all
                  telegrams entering or leaving the U.S.
                 - reminiscent of Yardley's arrangements in the 1920s
                    (and probably some others)
                 - known only to Louis Tordella and agents involved
                 - compartmentalization
               + Plot Links of Operation Shamrock to Operation Ultra
                  Black
                 - many links, from secrecy, compartmentalization, and
                    illegality to the methods used and the subversion of
                    government power
                 - "Shamrock was blown...Ultra Black burrowed even
                    deeper."
             + NSA, FBI, and surveillance of Cuban sympathizers
               - "watch list" used
               - were there links to Meyer Lansky and Trafficante via
                  the JFK-Mafia connection?
               - various Watergate break-in connections (Cubans used)
               - Hoover ended black-bag operations in 1967-8
             + NSA, FBI, and Dissenters (COINTELPRO-type activities)
               + 10/20/67   NSA is asked to begin collecting information
                  related to civil disturbances, war protesters, etc.
                 - Army Intelligence, Secret Service, CIA, FBI, DIA were
                    all involved
                 - arguably, this continues (given the success of FBI
                    and Secret Service in heading off major acts of
                    terrorism and attempted assassinations)
             + Huston Plan and Related Plans (1970-71)
               - 7/19/66   Hoover unofficially terminates black bag

                  operations
                 - fearing blowback, concerned about his place in

                      elimination of legal restrictions on domestic
                      surveillance (not that they had felt bound by
                      legalisms)

                 - pressure by Attorney General John Mitchell
                 - and perhaps by Hoover
                 - Huston demoted; he resigned a year later
                 - but the Plan was not really dead...perhaps Huston's
                    mistake was in being young and vocal and making the
                    report too visible and not deniable enough
               + 12/3/70   Intelligence Evaluation Committee (IEC) meets

           + FINCEN, IRS, and Other Economic Surveillance
             - set up in Arlington as a group to monitor the flows of
                money and information
             + eventually these groups will see the need to actively
                hack into computer systems used by various groups that
                are under investigation
               - ties to the death of Alan Standorf? (Vint Hill)
               - Casolaro, Riconosciutto
   11.3.6. "Does the government want to monitor economic transactions?"
           - Incontrovertibly, they _want_ to. Whether they have actual
              plans to do so is more debatable. The Clipper and Digital
              Telephony proposals are but two of the indications they
              have great plans laid to ensure their surveillance
              capabilities are maintained and extended.
           - The government will get increasingly panicky as more Net
              commerce develops, as trade moves offshore, and as
              encryption spreads.
   11.3.7. A danger of the surveillance society: You can't hide
           - seldom discussed as a concern
           - no escape valve, no place for those who made mistakes to
              escape to
           - (historically, this is a way for criminals to get back on a
              better track--if a digital identity means their record
              forever follows them, this may...)
           + A growing problem in America and other "democratic"
              countries is the tendency to make mandatory what were once
              voluntary choices. For example, fingerprinting children to
              help in kidnapping cases may be a reasonable thing to do
              voluntarily, but some school districts are planning to make
              it mandatory.
             - This is all part of the "Let's pass a law" mentality.
   11.3.8. "Should I refuse to give my Social Security Number to those
            who ask for it?"
           - It's a bit off of crypto, but the question does keep coming
              up on the Cypherpunks list.
           - Actually, they don't even need to ask for it
              anymore....it's attached to so many _other_ things that pop
              up when they enter your name that it's a moot point. In
              other words, the same dossiers that allow the credit card
              companies to send you "preapproved credit cards" every few
              days are the same dossiers that MCI, Sprint, AT&T, etc. are
              using to sign you up.
   11.3.9. "What is 'Privacy 101'?"
           - I couldn't think of a better way to introduce the topic of
              how individuals can protect their privacy, avoid
              interference by the government, and (perhaps) avoid taxes.
           - Duncan Frissell and Sandy Sandfort have given out a lot of
              tips on this, some of them just plain common sense, some of
              them more arcane.
           + They are conducting a seminar, entitled "PRIVACY 101" and
              the archives of this are available by Web at:
             - http://www.iquest.com/~fairgate/privacy/index.html
  11.3.10. Cellular phones are trackable by region...people are getting
            phone calls as they cross into new zones, "welcoming" them
           - but it implies that their position is already being tracked
  11.3.11. Ubiquitous use of SSNs and other personal I.D.
  11.3.12. cameras that can recognize faces are placed in many public
            places, e.g., airports, ports of entry, government buildings
           - and even in some private places, e.g., casinos, stores that
              have had problems with certain customers, banks that face
              robberies, etc.
  11.3.13. speculation (for the paranoids)
           - covert surveillance by noninvasive detection
              methods...positron emission tomography to see what part of
              the brain is active (think of the paranoia possibility!)
           - typically needs special compounds, but...
  11.3.14. Diaries are no longer private
           + can be opened under several conditions
             - subpoena in trial
             - discovery in various court cases, including divorce,
                custody, libel, etc.
             - business dealings
             - psychiatrists (under Tarasoff ruling) can have records
                opened; whatever one may think of the need for crimes
                confessed to shrinks to be reported, this is certainly a
                new era
           - Packwood diary case establishes the trend: diaries are no
              longer sacrosanct
           - An implication for crypto and Cypherpunks topics is that
              diaries and similar records may be stored in encrypted
              forms, or located in offshore locations. There may be more
              and more use of offshore or encrypted records.
 
 11.4. U.S. Intelligence Agencies: NSA, FinCEN, CIA, DIA, NRO, FBI
   11.4.1. The focus here is on U.S. agencies, for various reasons. Most
            Cypherpunks are currently Americans, the NSA has a dominant
            role in surveillance technology, and the U.S. is the focus of
            most current crypto debate. (Britain has the GCHQ, Canada has
            its own SIGINT group, the Dutch have...., France has DGSE and
            so forth, and...)
   11.4.2. Technically, not all are equal. And some may quibble with my
            calling the FBI an "intelligence agency." All have
            surveillance and monitoring functions, albeit of different
            flavors.
   11.4.3. "Is the NSA involved in domestic surveillance?"
           + Not completely confirmed, but much evidence that the answer
              is "yes":
             * previous domestic surveillance (Operation Shamrock,
                telegraphs, ITT, collusion with FBI, etc.)
             * reciprocal arrangements with GCHQ (U.K.)
             * arrangements on Indian reservations for microwave
                intercepts
             * the general technology allows it (SIGINT, phone lines)
             * the National Security Act of 1947, and later
                clarifications and Executive Orders, makes it likely
           - And the push for Digital Telephony.
   11.4.4. "What will be the effects of widespread crypto use on
            intelligence collection?"
           - Read Bamford for some stuff on how the NSA intercepts
              overseas communications, how they sold deliberately-
              crippled crypto machines to Third World nations, and how
              much they fear the spread of strong, essentially
              unbreakable crypto. "The Puzzle Palace" was published in
              1982...things have only gotten worse in this regard since.
           - Statements from senior intelligence officials reflect this
              concern.
           - Digital dead drops will change the whole espionage game.
              Information markets, data havens, untraceable e-mail...all
              of these things will have a profound effect on national
              security issues.
           - I expect folks like Tom Clancy to be writing novels about
              how U.S. national security interests are being threatened
              by "unbreakable crypto." (I like some Clancy novels, but
              there's no denying he is a right-winger who's openly
              critical of social trends, and that he believes druggies
              should be killed, the government is necessary to ward off
              evil, and ordinary citizens ought not to have tools the
              government can't overcome.)
   11.4.5. "What will the effects of crypto on conventional espionage?"
           - Massive effects; watch out for this to be cited as a reason
              to ban or restrict crypto--however pointless that may be.
           + Effects:
             - information markets, a la BlackNet
             - digital dead drops -- why use Coke cans near oak trees
                when you can put messages into files and post them
                worldwide, with untraceably? (but, importantly, with a
                digital signature!)
             - transparency of borders
             - arms trade, arms deals
             - virus, weaponry
   11.4.6. NSA budget
           - $27 billion over 6 years, give or take
           - may actually increase, despite end of Cold War
           - new threats, smaller states, spread of nukes, concerns
              about trade, money-laundering, etc.
           - first rule of bureaucracies: they always get bigger
           + NSA-Cray Computer supercomputer
             + press release, 1994-08-17, gives some clues about the
                capabilities sought by the surveillance state
               - "The Cray-3/SSS will be a hybrid system capable of
                  vector parallel processing, scalable parallel
                  processing and a combination of both. The system will
                  consist of a dual processor 256 million word Cray-3 and
                  a 512,000 processor 128 million byte single instruction
                  multiple data (SIMD) array......SIMD arrays of one
                  million processors are expected to be possible using
                  the current version of the Processor-In-Memory (PIM)
                  chips developed by the Supercomputing Research Center
                  once the development project is completed. The PIM chip
                  contains 64 single-bit processors and 128 kilobyte bits
                  of memory. Cray Computer will package PIM chips
                  utilizing its advanced multiple chip module packaging
                  technology. The chips are manufactured by National
                  Semiconductor Corporation."
             - This is probably the supercomputer described in the
                Gunter Ahrendt report
   11.4.7. FINCEN, IRS, and Other Economic Surveillance
           - Financial Crimes Enforcement Network, a consortium or task
              force made up of DEA, DOJ, FBI, CIA, DIA, NSA, IRS, etc.
           - set up in Arlington as a group to monitor the flows of
              money and information
           - eventually these groups will see the need to hack into
              computer systems used by various groups that are under
              investigation
           - Cf. "Wired," either November or December, 1993
   11.4.8. "Why are so many computer service, telecom, and credit agency
            companies located near U.S. intelligence agency sites?"
           + For example, the cluster of telecom and credit reporting
              agencies (TRW Credit, Transunion, etc.) in and around the
              McLean/Langley area of Northern Virginia (including
              Herndon, Vienna, Tyson's Corner, Chantilly, etc.)
             - same thing for, as I recall, various computer network
                providers, such as UUCP (or whatever), America Online,
                etc.
           - The least conspiratorial view: because all are located near
              Washington, D.C., for various regulatory, lobbying, etc.
              reasons
           + The most conspiratorial view: to ensure that the
              intelligence agencies have easy access to communications,
              direct landlines, etc.
             - credit reporting agencies need to clear identities that
                are fabricated for the intelligence agencies, WitSec,
                etc. (the three major credit agencies have to be
                complicit in these creations, as the "ghosts" show up
                immediately when past records are cross-correlated)
             - As Paul Ferguson, Cypherpunk and manager at US Sprint,
                puts it: "We're located in Herndon, Virginia, right
                across the street from Dulles Airport and a hop, skip &
                jump down the street from the new NRO office.   ,-)"
                [P.F., 1994-08-18]
   11.4.9. Task Force 157, ONI, Kissinger, Castle Bank, Nugan Hand Bank,
            CIA
  11.4.10. NRO building controversy
           - and an agency I hadn't seen listed until August, 1994: "The
              Central Imagery Office"
  11.4.11. SIGINT listening posts
           + possible monkeywrenching?
             - probably too hard, even for an EMP bomb (non-nuclear,
                that is)
  11.4.12. "What steps is the NSA taking?"
           * besides death threats against Jim Bidzos, that is
           * Clipper a plan to drive competitors out (pricing, export
              laws, harassment)
           * cooperation with other intelligence agencies, other nations
             - New World Order
           * death threats were likely just a case of bullying...but
              could conceivably be part of a campaign of terror--to shut
              up critics or at least cause them to hesitate
 
 11.5. Surveillance in Other Countries
   11.5.1. Partly this overlaps on the earlier discussion of crypto laws
            in other countries.
   11.5.2. Major Non-U.S. Surveillance Organizations
           + BnD -- Bundesnachrichtendienst
             - German security service
             - BND is seeking constitutional amendment, buy may not need
                it, as the mere call for it told everyone what is already
                existing
             - "vacuum cleaner in the ether"
             - Gehlen...Eastern Front Intelligence
             - Pullach, outside Munchen
             - they have always tried to get the approval to do domestic
                spying...a key to power
           + Bundeskriminalamt (BKA) -- W. German FBI
             - HQ is at Wiesbaden
             - bomb blew up there when being examined, killing an
                officer (related to Pan Am/Lockerbie/PFLP-GC)
             - sign has double black eagles (back to back)
           - BVD -- Binnenlandse Veiligheids Dienst, Dutch Internal
              Security Service
           + SDECE
             - French intelligence (foreign intelligence), linked to
                Greepeace ship bombing in New Zealand?
             - SDECE had links to the October Surprise, as some French
                agents were in on the negotiations, the arms shipments
                out of Marseilles and Toulon, and in meetings with
                Russbacher and the others
           - DST, Direction de la Surveillance du Territoire,
              counterespionage arm of France (parallel to FBI)
           + DSGE, Direction GŽnŽrale de la SŽcuritŽ ExtŽriere
             - provides draft deferments for those who deliver stolen
                information
           + Sweden, Forsvarets Radioanstalt ("Radio Agency of the
              Defense")
             - cracked German communications between occupied Norway and
                occupied Denmark
             - Beurling, with paper and pencil only
           + Mossad, LAKAM, Israel
             + HQ in Tel Aviv, near HQ of AMAN, military intelligence
               - doesn't HQ move around a lot?
             - LAKAM (sp?),  a supersecret Israeli intelligence
                agency...was shown the PROMIS software in 1983
             + learned of the Pakistani success in building an atom bomb
                and took action against the Pakistani leadership:
                destruction of the plane carrying the President (Zia?)
                and some U.S. experts
               - Mossad knew of DIA and CIA involvement in BCCI
                  financing of Pakistani atom bomb efforts (and links to
                  other arms dealers that allowed triggers and the like
                  to reach Pakistan)
             - revelations by Vanunu were designed to scare the Arab and
                Muslim world-and to send a signal that the killing of
                President Zia was to be the fate of any Pakistani leader
                who continued the program
   11.5.3. They are very active, though they get less publicity than do
            the American CIA, NSA, FBI, etc.
 
 11.6. Surveillance Methods and Technology
   11.6.1. (some of this gets speculative and so may not be to
            everyone's liking)
   11.6.2. "What is TEMPEST and what's the importance of it?"
           - TEMPEST apprarently stands for nothing, and hence is not an
              acronym, just a name. The all caps is the standard
              spelling.
           - RF emission, a set of specs for complying
           - Van Eyck (or Van Eck?) radiation
           + Mostly CRTs are the concern, but also LCD panels and the
              internal circuitry of the PCs, workstations, or terminals.
             - "Many LCD screens can be read at a distance. The signal
                is not as strong as that from the worst vdus, but it is
                still considerable. I have demonstrated attacks on Zenith
                laptops at 10 metres or so with an ESL 400 monitoring
                receiver and a 4m dipole antenna; with a more modern
                receiver, a directional antenna and a quiet RF
                environment there is no reason why 100 metres should be
                impossible." [Ross Anderson, Tempest Attacks on Notebook
                Computers ???, comp.security.misc, 1994-08-31]
   11.6.3. What are some of the New Technologies for Espionage and
            Surveillance
           + Bugs
             + NSA and CIA have developed new levels of miniaturized
                bugs
               - e.g., passive systems that only dribble out intercepted
                  material when interrogated (e.g., when no  bug sweeps
                  are underway)
               - many of these new bugging technologies were used in the
                  John Gotti case in New York...the end of the Cold War
                  meant that many of these technologies became available
                  for use by the non-defense side
               - the use of such bugging technology is a frightening
                  development: conversations can be heard inside sealed
                  houses from across streets, and all that will be
                  required is an obligatory warrant
             + DRAM storage of compressed speech...6-bit companded,
                frequency-limited, so that 1 sec  of speech takes
                50Kbits, or 10K when compressed, for a total of 36 Mbits
                per hour-this will fit on a single chip
               - readout can be done from a "mothership" module (a
                  larger bug that sits in some more secure location)
               - or via tight-beam lasers
             + Bugs are Mobile
               - can crawl up walls, using the MIT-built technology for
                  microrobots
               - some can even fly for short distances (a few klicks)
           + Wiretaps
             - so many approaches here
             - phone switches are almost totally digital (a la ESS IV)
             - again, software hacks to allow wiretaps
           + Vans equipped to eavesdrop on PCs and networks
             + TEMPEST systems
               + technology is somewhat restricted, companies doing this
                  work are under limitations not to ship to some
                  customers
                 - no laws against shielding, of course
             - these vans are justified for the "war on drugs" and
                weapons proliferation controle efforts (N.E.S.T., anti-
                Iraq, etc.)
           + Long-distance listening
             - parabolic reflectors, noise cancellation (from any off-
                axis sources), high gain amplification, phoneme analysis
             - neural nets that learn the speech patterns and so can
                improve clarity
           + lip-reading
             - with electronically stabilized CCD imagers, 3000mm lenses
             - neural net-based lip-reading programs, with learning
                systems capable of improving performance
           - for those in sensitive positions, the availability of new
              bugging methods will accelerate the conversion to secure
              systems based on encrypted telecommunications and the
              avoidance of voice-based systems
   11.6.4. Digital Telephony II is a major step toward easier
            surveillance
   11.6.5. Citizen tracking
           + the governments of the world would obviously like to trace
              the movements, or at least the major movements, of their
              subjects
             - makes black markets a bit more difficult
             - surfaces terrorists, illegal immigrants, etc. (not
                perfectly)
             + allows tracking of "sex offenders"
               - who often have to register with the local police,
                  announce to their neighbors their previous crimes, and
                  generally wear a scarlet letter at all times--I'm not
                  defending rapists and child molesters, just noting the
                  dangerous precedent this is setting
             - because its the nature of bureaucracies to want to know
                where "their" subjects are (dossier society = accounting
                society...records are paramount)
           + Bill Stewart has pointed out that the national health care
              systems, and the issuance of social security numbers to
              children, represent a way to track the movements of
              children, through hospital visits, schools, etc. Maybe even
              random check points at places where children gather (malls,
              schools, playgrounds, opium dens, etc.)
             - children in such places are presumed to have lesser
                rights, hence...
             - this could all be used to track down kidnapped children,
                non-custodial parents, etc.
             - this could be a wedge in the door: as the children age,
                the system is already in place to continue the tracking
                (about the right timetable, too...start the systme this
                decade and by 2010 or 2020, nearly everybody will be in
                it)
             - (A true paranoid would link these ideas to the child
                photos many schools are requring, many local police
                departments are officially assisting with, etc. A dossier
                society needs mug shots on all the perps.)
           - These are all reasons why governments will continue to push
              for identity systems and will seek to derail efforts at
              providing anonymity
           + Surveillance and Personnel Identification
             + cameras that can recognize faces are placed in many
                public places, e.g., airports, ports of entry, government
                buildings
               - and even in some private places, e.g., casinos, stores
                  that have had problems with certain customers, banks
                  that face robberies, etc.
             + "suspicious movements detectors"
               + cameras that track movements, loitering, eye contact
                  with other patrons
                 + neural nets used to classify behvaiors
                   - legal standing not needed, as these systems are
                      used only to trigger further surveillance, not to
                      prove guilt in a court of law
                 - example: banks have cameras, by 1998, that can
                    identify potential bank robbers
                 - camera images are sent to a central monitoring
                    facility, so the usual ploy of stopping the silent
                    alarm won't work
               - airports and train stations (fears of terrorists),
                  other public places
   11.6.6. Cellular phones are trackable by region...people are getting
            phone calls as they cross into new zones, "welcoming" them
           - but it implies that their position is already being tracked
   11.6.7. coming surveillance, Van Eck, piracy, vans
           - An interesting sign of things to come is provided in this
              tale from a list member:  "In Britain we have 'TV detector
              Vans'. These are to detect licence evaders (you need to pay
              an annual licence for the BBC channels). They are provided
              by the Department of Trade and Industry. They use something
              like a small minibus and use Van Eck principles. They have
              two steerable detectors on the van roof so they can
              triangulate. But TV shops have to notify the Government of
              buyers - so that is the basic way in which licence evaders
              are detected. ... I read of a case on a bulletin board
              where someone did not have a TV but used a PC. He got a
              knock on the door. They said he appeared to have a TV but
              they could not make out what channel he was watching!
              [Martin Spellman, <mspellman@cix.compulink.co.uk>, 1994-
              0703]
           - This kind of surveillance is likely to become more and more
              common, and raises serious questions about what _other_
              information they'll look for. Perhaps the software piracy
              enforcers (Software Publishers Association) will look for
              illegal copies of Microsoft Word or SimCity!   (This area
              needs more discussion, obviously.)
   11.6.8. wiretaps
           - supposed to notify targets within 90 days, unless extended
              by a judge
           - Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act cases are exempt from
              this (it is likely that Cypherpunks wiretapped, if they
              have been, for crypto activities fall under this
              case...foreigners, borders being crossed, national security
              implications, etc. are all plausible reasons, under the
              Act)
 
 11.7. Surveillance Targets
   11.7.1. Things the Government May Monitor
           - besides the obvious things like diplomatic cable traffic,
              phone calls from and to suspected terrorists and criminals,
              etc.
           + links between Congressmen and foreign embassies
             - claims in NYT (c. 9-19-91) that CIA had files on
                Congressmen opposing aid to Contras
           + Grow lamps for marijuana cultivation
             - raids on hydroponic supply houses and seizure of mailing
                lists
             - records of postings to alt.drugs and alt.psychoactive
             - vitamin buyers clubs
           + Energy consumption
             - to spot use of grow lamps
             + but also might be refined to spot illegal aliens being
                sheltered or any other household energy consumption
                "inconsistent with reported uses"
               - same for water, sewage, etc.
           + raw chemicals
             - as with monitors on ammonium nitrate and other bomb
                materials
             - or feedstock for cocaine production (recall various
                seizures of shipments of chemicals to Latin America)
           - checkout of books, a la FBI's "Library Awareness Program"
              of around 1986 or so
           - attendance at key conferences, such as Hackers Conference
              (could have scenes involving this), Computer Security
              Conference
   11.7.2. Economic Intelligence (Spying on Corporations, Foreign and
            Domestic)
           + "Does the NSA use economic intelligence data obtained in
              intercepts?"
             - Some of us speculate that this is so, that this has been
                going on since the 1960s at least. For example, Bamford
                noted in 1982 that the NSA had foreknowledge of the plans
                by the British to devalue the pound in the late 1970s,
                and knowledge of various corporate plans.
             - The NSA clears codes used by the CIA, so it seem
                impossible for the NSA not to have known about CIA drug
                smuggling activities. The NSA is very circumspect,
                however, and rarely (or never) comments.
           + there have been calls for the government to somehow help
              American business and overall competitiveness by "levelling
              the playing field" via espionage
             - especially as the perceived threat of the Soviet bloc
                diminishes and as the perceived threat of Japan and
                Germany increases
           - leaders of the NSA and CIA have even talked openly about
              turning to economic surveillance
           + Problems with this proposal:
             - illegal
             - unethical
             + who gets the intelligence information? Does NSA just call
                up Apple and say "We've intercepted some message from
                Taiwan that describe their plans for factories. Are you
                interested?"
               - the U.S. situation differs from Japan and MITI (which
                  is often portrayed as the model for how this ought to
                  work) in that we have many companies with little or no
                  history of obeying government recommendations
             + and foreign countries will likely learn of this espionage
                and take appropriate measures
               - e.g., by increasing encryption
   11.7.3. War on Drugs and Money Laundering is Causing Increase in
            Surveillance and Monitoring
           - monitoring flows of capital, cash transactions, etc.
           - cooperation with Interpol, foreign governments, even the
              Soviets and KGB (or whatever becomes of them)
           - new radar systems are monitoring light aircraft, boats,
              etc.
 
 11.8. Legal Issues
   11.8.1. "Can my boss monitor my work?" "Can my bankruptcy in 1980 be
            used to deny me a loan?" etc.
           - Libertarians have a very different set of answers than do
              many others: the answer to all these questions is mostly
              "yes," morally (sorry for the normative view).
   11.8.2. Theme: to protect some rights, invasion of privacy is being
            justified
           - e.g., by forcing employer records to be turned over, or of
              seizing video rental records (on the grounds of catching
              sexual deviants)
           - various laws about employee monitoring
   11.8.3. Government ID cards, ability to fake identities
           - The government uses its powers to forge credentials, with
              the collusion of the major credit agencies (who obviously
              see these fake identities "pop into existence full-blown."
           - WitSec, FINCen, false IDs, ties to credit card companies
           - DEA stings, Heidi in La Jolla, Tava, fake tax returns, fake
              bank applications, fake IDs
           - the "above it all" attitude is typical of this...who guards
              the guardians?
           - WitSec, duplicity
   11.8.4. Legalities of NSA surveillance
           - read Bamford for some circa 1982 poinra
           - UK-USA
           - ECPA
           - national security exemptions
           - lots of confusion; however, the laws have never had any
              real influence, and I cannot imagine the NSA being sued!
 
 11.9. Dossiers and Data Bases
   11.9.1. "The dossier never forgets"
           + any transgressions of any law in any country can be stored
              indefinitely, exposing the transgressor to arrest and
              detention anytime he enters a country with such a record on
              him
             - (This came up with regard to the British having quaint
                ideas about computer security, hacking, and data privacy;
                it is quite possible that an American passing through
                London could be detained for some obscure violation years
                in the past.)
           - this is especially worrisome in a society in which legal
              codes fill entire rooms and in which nearly every day
              produces some violation of some law
   11.9.2. "What about the privacy issues with home shopping, set-top
            boxes, advertisers, and the NII?"
           - Do we want our preferences in toothpaste fed into databases
              so that advertisers can target us? Or that our food
              purchases be correlated and analyzed by the government to
              spot violations of the Dietary Health Act?
           - First, laws which tell people what records they are
              "allowed" to keep are wrong-headed, and lead to police
              state inspections of disk drives, etc. The so-called "Data
              Privacy" laws of several European nations are a nightmare.
              Strong crypto makes them moot.
           - Second, it is mostly up to people to protect what they want
              protected, not to pass laws demanding that others protect
              it for them.
           - In practice, this means either use cash or make
              arrangements with banks and credit card companies that will
              protect privacy. Determining if they have or not is another
              issue, but various ideas suggest themselves (John Gilmore
              says he often joins groups under variants of his name, to
              see who is selling his name to mailing lists.)
           - Absent any laws which forbid them, privacy-preserving
              credit card companies will likely spring up if there's a
              market demand. Digital cash is an example. Other variants
              abound. Cypherpunks should not allow such alternatives to
              be banned, and should of course work on their own such
              systems.
   11.9.3. credit agencies
           - TRW Credit, Transunion, Equifax
           - links to WitSec
   11.9.4. selling of data bases, linking of records...
           - several states have admitted to selling their driver's
              license data bases

11.10. Police States and Informants
  11.10.1. Police states need a sense of terror to help magnify the
            power or the state, a kind of "shrechlichkeit," as the Nazis
            used to call it. And lots of informants. Police states need
            willing accomplices to turn in their neighbors, or even their
            parents, just as little Pavel Morozov became a Hero of the
            Soviet People by sending his parents to their deaths in
            Stalin's labor camps for the crime of expressing negative
            opinions about the glorious State.
           - (The canonization of Pavel Morozov was recently repudiated
              by current Russian leaders--maybe even by the late-Soviet
              era leades, like Gorbachev--who pointed out the corrosive
              effects of encouraging families to narc on each
              other...something the U.S. has forgotten...will it be 50
              years before our leaders admit that having children turn in
              Daddy for using "illegal crypto" was not such a good idea?)
  11.10.2. Children are encouraged in federally-mandated D.A.R.E.
            programs to become Junior Narcs, narcing their parents out to
            the cops and counselors who come into their schools.
  11.10.3. The BATF has a toll-free line (800-ATF-GUNS) for snitching on
            neighbors who one thinks are violating the federal gun laws.
            (Reports are this is backfiring, as gun owners call the
            number to report on local liberal politicians and gun-
            grabbers.)
  11.10.4. Some country we live in, eh? (Apologies to non-U.S. readers,
            as always.)
  11.10.5. The implications for use of crypto, for not trusting others,
            etc., are clear
  11.10.6. Dangers of informants
           + more than half of all IRS prosecutions arise out of tips by
              spouses and ex-spouses...they have the inside dope, the
              motive, and the means
             - a sobering thought even in the age of crypto
           + the U.S. is increasing a society of narcs and stool
              pigeons, with "CIs" (confidential informants), protected
              witnesses (with phony IDs and lavish lifestyles), and with
              all sorts of vague threats and promises
             - in a system with tens of thousands of laws, nearly all
                behavior breaks at least some laws, often unavoidably,
                and hence a powerful sword hangs over everyone's head
           - corrosion of trust, especially within families (DARE
              program in schools encourages children to narc on their
              parents who are "substance abusers"!)

11.11. Privacy Laws
  11.11.1. Will proposed privacy laws have an effect?
           + I suspect just the opposite: the tangled web of laws-part
              of the totalitarian freezeout-will "marginalize" more
              people and cause them to seek ways to protect their own
              privacy and protect themselves from sanctions over their
              actions
             + free speech vs. torts, SLAPP suits, sedition charges,
                illegal research, etc.
               - free speech is vanishing under a torrent of laws,
                  licensing requirements, and even zoning rules
             + outlawing of work on drugs, medical procedures, etc.
               - against the law to disseminate information on drug use
                  (MDMA case at Stanford), on certain kinds of birth
                  control
             - "If encrytion is outlawed, only outlaws will have
                encryption."
           + privacy laws are already causing encryption ("file
              protection") to be mandatory in many cases, as with medical
              records, transmission of sensitive files, etc.
             - by itself this is not in conflict with the government
                requirement for tappable access, but the practical
                implementation of a two-tier system-secure against
                civilian tappers but readable by national security
                tappers-is a nightmare and is likely impossible to
                achieve
  11.11.2. "Why are things like the "Data Privacy Laws" so bad?"
           - Most European countries have laws that limit the collection
              of computerized records, dossiers, etc., except for
              approved uses (and the governments themselves and their
              agents).
           - Americans have no such laws. I've heard calls for this,
              which I think is too bad.
           - While we may not like the idea of others compiling dossiers
              on us, stopping them is an even worse situation. It gives
              the state the power to enter businesses, homes, and examine
              computers (else it is completely unenforceable). It creates
              ludicrous situations in which, say, someone making up a
              computerized list of their phone contacts is compiling an
              illegal database! It makes e-mail a crime (those records
              that are kept).
           - they are themselves major invasions of privacy
           - are you going to put me in jail because I have data bases
              of e-mail, Usenet posts, etc.?
           - In my opinion, advocates of "privacy" are often confused
              about this issue, and fail to realize that laws about
              privacy often take away the privacy rights of _others_.
              (Rights are rarely in conflict--contract plus self-privacy
              take care of 99% of situations where rights are purported
              to be in conflict.)
  11.11.3. on the various "data privacy laws"
           - many countries have adopted these data privacy laws,
              involving restrictions on the records that can be kept, the
              registration of things like mailing lists, and heavy
              penalties for those found keeping computer files deemed
              impermissable
           - this leads to invasions of privacy....this very Cypherpunks
              list would have to be "approved" by a bureaucrat in many
              countries...the oportunites (and inevitabilities) of abuse
              are obvious
           - "There is a central contradiction running through the
              dabase regulations proposed by many so-called "privacy
              advocates".  To be enforceable they require massive
              government snooping into database activities on our
              workstatins and PCs,  especially the activities of many
              small at-home businesses (such as mailing list
              entrepreneurs who often work out of the home).
              
              "Thus, the upshot of these so-called "privacy" regulations
              is to destroy our last shreds of privacy against
              government, and calm us into blindly letting even more of
              the details of our personal lives into the mainframes of
              the major government agencies and credit reporting
              agenices, who if they aren't explicitly excepted from the
              privacy laws (as is common) can simply evade them by using
              offshore havesn, mutual agreements with foreign
              investigators, police and intelligence agencies."  [Jim
              Hart, 1994-09-08]
  11.11.4. "What do Cypherpunks think about this?"
           + divided minds...while no one likes being monitored, the
              question is how far one can go to stop others from being
              monitored
             - "Data Privacy Laws" as a bad example: tramples on freedom
                to write, to keep one's computer private
  11.11.5. Assertions to data bases need to be checked (credit,
            reputation, who said what, etc.)
           - if I merely assert that Joe Blow no longer is employed, and
              this spreads...

11.12. National ID Systems
  11.12.1. "National ID cards are just the driver's licenses on the
            Information Superhighway." [unknown...may have been my
            coining]
  11.12.2. "What's the concern?"
  11.12.3. Insurance and National Health Care will Produce the "National
            ID" that will be Nearly Unescapable
           - hospitals and doctors will have to have the card...cash
              payments will  evoke suspicion and may not even be feasible
  11.12.4. National ID Card Arguments
           - "worker's permit" (another proposal, 1994-08, that would
              call for a national card authorizing work permission)
           - immigration, benefit
           - possible tie-in to the system being proposed by the US
              Postal Service: a registry of public keys (will they also
              "issue" the private-public key pair?)
           - software key escrow and related ideas
           - "I doubt that one would only have to "flash" your card and
              be on your way.  More correctly, one would have to submit
              to being "scanned" and be on your way.   This would also
              serve to be a convienient locator tag if installed in the
              toll systems and miscellaneous "security checkpoints".  Why
              would anyone with nothing to hide care if your every move
              could be monitored?  Its for your own good, right?  Pretty
              soon sliding your ID into slots in everyplace you go will
              be common." [Korac MacArthur, comp.org.eff.talk, 1994-07-
              25]
  11.12.5. "What are some concerns about Universal ID Cards?"
           - "Papierren, bitte! Schnell!
           - that they would allow traceability to the max (as folks
              used to say)... tracking of movements, erosion of privacy
           - that they would be required to be used for banking
              transactions, Net access, etc. (As usual, there may be
              workarounds, hacks, ...)
           - "is-a-person" credentially, where government gets involved
              in the issuance of cryptographic keys (a la the USPS
              proposal), where only "approved uses" are allowed, etc.
           - timestamps, credentials
  11.12.6. Postal Service trial balloon for national ID card
           - "While it is true that they share technology, their intent
              and purpose is very different.  Chaum's proposal has as its
              intent  and purpose to provide and protect anonymity in
              financial transactions.  The intent and purpose of the US
              Postal Service is to identify and authenticate you to the
              government and to guarantee the traceability of all
              financial transactions." [WHMurray, alt.privacy, 1994-07-
              04]
  11.12.7. Scenario for introduction of national ID cards
           - Imagine that vehicle registrations require presentation of
              this card (gotta get those illegals out of their cars, or,
              more benignly, the bureaucracy simply makes the ID cars
              part of their process).
           - Instantly this makes those who refuse to get an ID card
              unable to get valid license tags. (Enforcement is already
              pretty good....I was pulled over a couple of times for
              either forgetting to put my new stickers on, or for driving
              with Oregon expired tags.)
           + The "National Benefits Card," for example, is then required
              to get license plate tags.and maybe other things, like car
              and home insurance, etc. It would be very difficult to
              fight such a card, as one could not drive, could not pay
              taxes ("Awhh!" I hear you say, but consider the penalties,
              the tie-ins with employers, etc. You can run but you can't
              hide.)
             - the national ID card would presumably be tied in to
                income tax filings, in various ways I won't go into here.
                The Postal Service, aiming to get into this area I guess,
                has floated the idea of electronic filing, ID systems,
                etc.
  11.12.8. Comments on national ID cards
           - That some people will be able to skirt the system, or that
              the system will ultimately be unenforceable, does not
              lessen the concern. Things can get real tough in the
              meantime.
           - I see great dangers here, in tying a national ID card to
              transactions we are essentially unable to avoid in this
              society: driving, insurance (and let's not argue
              insurance...I mean it is unavoidable in the sense of legal
              issues, torts, etc.), border crossings, etc. Now how will
              one file taxes without such a card if one is made mandatory
              for interactions with the government? Saying "taxes are not
              collectable" is not an adequate answer. They may not be
              collectible for street punks and others who inhabit the
              underground economy, but they sure are for most of us.

11.13. National Health Care System Issues
  11.13.1. Insurance and National Health Care will Produce the "National
            ID" that will be Nearly Unescapable
           - hospitals and doctors will have to have the card...cash
              payments will  evoke suspicion and may not even be feasible
  11.13.2. I'm less worried that a pharmacist will add me to some
            database he keeps than that my doctor will be instructed to
            compile a dossier to government standards and then zip it off
            over the Infobahn to the authorities.
  11.13.3. Dangers and issues of National Health Care Plan
           - tracking, national ID card
           - "If you think the BATF is bad, wait until the BHCRCE goes
              into action. "What is the BHCRCE?" you ask. Why, it the
              Burea of Health Care Reform Compliance Enforcement - the
              BATF, FBI, FDA, CIA and IRS all rolled into one."  [Dave
              Feustel, talk.politics.guns, 1994-08-19]
           - Bill Stewart has pointed out the dangers of children having
              social security numbers, of tracking systems in schools and
              hospitals, etc.

11.14. Credentials
  11.14.1. This is one of the most overlooked and ignored aspects of
            cryptology, especially of Chaum's work. And no one in
            Cypherpunks or anywhere else is currently working on "blinded
            credentials" for everyday use.
  11.14.2. "Is proof of identity needed?"
           - This question is debated a lot, and is important. Talk of a
              national ID card (what wags call an "internal passport") is
              in the air, as part of health care, welfare, and
              immigration legislation. Electronic markets make this also
              an issue for the ATM/smart card community. This is also
              closely tied in with the nature of anonymous reamailers
              (where physical identity is of course generally lacking).
           + First, "identity" can mean different things:
             - Conventional View of Identity: Physical person, with
                birthdate, physical characteristics, fingerprints, social
                security numbers, passports, etc.--the whole cloud of
                "identity" items. (Biometric.)
             - Pseudonym View of Identity:  Persistent personnas,
                mediated with cryptography. "You are your key."
             - Most of us deal with identity as a mix of these views: we
                rarely check biometric credentials, but we also count on
                physical clues (voice, appearance, etc.). I assume that
                when I am speaking to "Duncan Frissell," whom I've never
                met in person, that he is indeed Duncan Frissell. (Some
                make the jump from this expectation to wanting the
                government enforce this claim, that is, provided I.D.)
           + It is often claimed that physical identity is important in
              order to:
             - track down cheaters, welchers, contract breakes, etc.
             - permit some people to engage in some transactions, and
                forbid others to (age credentials, for drinking, for
                example, or---less benignly--work permits in some field)
             - taxation, voting, other schemes tied to physical
                existence
           + But most of us conduct business with people without ever
              verifying their identity credentials...mostly we take their
              word that they are "Bill Stewart" or "Scott Collins," and
              we never go beyond that.
             - this could change as digital credentials proliferate and
                as interactions cause automatic checks to be made (a
                reason many of us have to support Chaum's "blinded
                credentials" idea--without some crypto protections, we'll
                be constantly tracked in all interactions).
           + A guiding principle: Leave this question of whether to
              demand physical ID  credentials up to the *parties
              involved*. If Alice wants to see Bob's "is-a-person"
              credential, and take his palmprint, or whatever, that's an
              issue for them to work out. I see no moral reason, and
              certainly no communal reason, for outsiders to interfere
              and insist that ID be produced (or that ID be forbidden,
              perhaps as some kind of "civil rights violation"). After
              all, we interact in cyberspace, on the Cypherpunks list,
              without any such external controls on identity.
             - and business contracts are best negotiated locally, with
                external enforcement contracted by the parties (privately-
                produced law, already seen with insurance companies,
                bonding agents, arbitration arrangements, etc.)
           - Practically speaking, i.e., not normatively speaking,
              people will find ways around identity systems. Cash is one
              way, remailers are another. Enforcement of a rigid identity-
              based system is difficult.
  11.14.3. "Do we need "is-a-person" credentials for things like votes
            on the Net?"
           - That is, any sysadmin can easily create as many user
              accounts as he wishes. And end users can sign up with
              various services under various names. The concern is that
              this Chicago-style voting (fictitious persons) may be used
              to skew votes on Usenet.
           - Similar concerns arise elsewhere.
           - In my view, this is a mighty trivial reason to support "is-
              a-person" credentials.
  11.14.4. Locality, credentials, validations
           + Consider the privacy implications of something so simple as
              a parking lot system. Two main approaches:
             - First Approach. Cash payment. Car enters lot, driver pays
                cash, a "validation" is given. No traceability exists.
                (There's a small chance that one driver can give his
                sticker to a new driver, and thus defraud the parking
                lot. This tends not to happen, due to the inconveniences
                of making a market in such stickers (coordinating with
                other car, etc.) and because the sticker is relatively
                inexpensive.)
             - Second Approach. Billing of driver, recording of license
                plates. Traceability is present, especially if the local
                parking lot is tied in to credit card companies, DMV,
                police, etc. (these link-ups are on the wish list of
                police agencies, to further "freeze out" fugitives, child
                support delinquents, and other criminals).
           - These are the concerns of a society with a lot of
              electronic payments but with no mechanisms for preserving
              privacy. (And there is currently no great demand for this
              kind of privacy, for a variety of reasons, and this
              undercuts the push for anonymous credential methods.)
           - An important property of true cash (gold, bank notes that
              are well-trusted) is that it settles immediately, requiring
              no time-binding of contracts (ability to track down the
              payer and collect on a bad transaction)

11.15. Records of all UseNet postings
  11.15.1. (ditto for CompuServe, GEnie, etc.) will exist
  11.15.2. "What kinds of monitoring of the Net is possible?"
           - Archives of all Usenet traffic. This is already done by
              commercial CD-ROm suppliers, and others, so this would be
              trivial for various agencies.
           - Mail archives. More problematic, as mail is ostensibly not
              public. But mail passes through many sites, usually in
              unencrypted form.
           - Traffic analysis. Connections monitored. Telnet, ftp, e-
              mail, Mosaid, and other connections.
           - Filtered scans of traffic, with keyword-matched text stored
              in archives.
  11.15.3. Records: note that private companies can do the same thing,
            except that various "right to privacy" laws may try to
            interfere with this
           - which causes its own constitutional privacy problems, of
              course
  11.15.4. "How can you expect that something you sent on the UseNet to
            several thousand sites will not be potentially held against
            you? You gave up any pretense of privacy when you broadcast
            your opinions-and even detailed declarations of your
            activities-to an audience of millions. Did you really think
            that these public messages weren't being filed away? Any
            private citizen would find it almost straightforward to sort
            a measly several megabytes a day by keywords, names of
            posters, etc." [I'm not sure if I wrote this, or if someone
            else who I forgot to make a note of did]
  11.15.5. this issue is already coming up: a gay programmer who was
            laid-off discussed his rage on one of the gay boards and said
            he was thinking of turning in his former employer for
            widespread copying of Autocad software...an Autodesk employee
            answered him with "You just did!"
  11.15.6. corporations may use GREP and On Location-like tools to
            search public nets for any discussion of themselves or their
            products
           - by big mouth employees, by disgruntled customers, by known
              critics, etc.
           - even positive remarks that may be used in advertising
              (subject to various laws)
  11.15.7. the 100% traceability of public postings to UseNet and other
            bulletin boards is very stifling to free expression and
            becomes one of the main justifications for the use of
            anonymous (or pseudononymous) boards and nets
           - there may be calls for laws against such compilation, as
              with the British data laws, but basically there is little
              that can be done when postings go to tens of thousands of
              machines and are archived in perpetuity by many of these
              nodes and by thousands of readers
           - readers who may incorporate the material into their own
              postings, etc. (hence the absurdity of the British law)

11.16. Effects of Surveillance on the Spread of Crypto
  11.16.1. Surveillance and monitoring will serve to increase the use of
            encryption, at first by people with something to hide, and
            then by others
           - a snowballing effect
           - and various government agencies will themselves use
              encryption to protect their files and their privacy
  11.16.2. for those in sensitive positions, the availability of new
            bugging methods will accelerate the conversion to secure
            systems based on encrypted telecommunications and the
            avoidance of voice-based systems
  11.16.3. Surveillance Trends
           + Technology is making citizen-unit surveillance more and
              more trivial
             + video cameras on every street corners are technologically
                easy to implement, for example
               - or cameras in stores, in airports, in other public
                  places
               - traffic cameras
             - tracking of purchases with credit cards, driver's
                licenses, etc.
             - monitoring of computer emissions (TEMPEST issues, often a
                matter of paranoid speculation)
             + interception of the Net...wiretapping, interception of
                unencrypted communications, etc.
               - and compilation of dossier entries based on public
                  postings
           + This all makes the efforts to head-off a person-tracking,
              credentials-based society all the more urgent.
              Monkeywrenching, sabotage, public education, and
              development of alternatives are all needed.
             - If the surveillance state grows as rapidly as it now
                appears to be doing, more desperate measures may be
                needed. Personally, I wouldn't shed any tears if
                Washington, D.C. and environs got zapped with a terrorist
                nuke; the innocents would be replaced quickly enough, and
                the death of so many political ghouls would surely be
                worth it. The destruction of Babylon.
             + We need to get the message about "blinded credentials"
                (which can show some field, like age, without showing all
                fields, including name and such) out there. More
                radically, we need to cause people to question why
                credentials are as important as many people seem to
                think.
               - I argue that credentials are rarely needed for mutually
                  agreed-upon transactions

11.17. Loose Ends
  11.17.1. USPS involvement in electronic mail, signatures,
            authentication (proposed in July-August, 1994)
           + Advantages:
             - many locations
             - a mission already oriented toward delivery
           + Disadvantages:
             - has performed terribly, compared to allowed compettion
                (Federal Express, UPS, Airborne, etc.)
             - it's linked to the goverment (now quasi-independent, but
                not really)
             - could become mandatory, or competition restricted to
                certain niches (as with the package services, which
                cannot have "routes" and are not allowed to compete in
                the cheap letter regime)
             - a large and stultified bureaucracy, with union labor
           - Links to other programs (software key escrow, Digital
              Telephony) not clear, but it seems likely that a quasi-
              governemt agency like the USPS would be cooperative with
              government, and would place limits on the crypto systems
              allowed.
  11.17.2. the death threats
           + An NSA official threatened to have Jim Bidzos killed if he
              did not change his position on some negotiation underway.
              This was reported in the newspaper and I sought
              confirmation:
             - "Everything reported in the Merc News is true. I am
                certain that he wasnot speaking for the agency, but when
                it happened he was quite serious, at least appeared to
                be.  There was a long silence after he made the threat,
                with a staring contest.  He was quite intense.
                
                "I respect and trust the other two who were in the room
                (they were shocked and literally speechless, staring into
                their laps) and plan to ask NSA for a written apology and
                confirmation that he was not speaking for the agency.
                We'll see if I get it.  If the incident made it into
                their trip reports, I have a chance of getting a letter."

  11.17.3. False identities...cannot just be "erased" from the computer
            memory banks. The web of associations, implications, rule
            firings...all mean that simple removal (or insertion of a
            false identity) produces discontinuities, illogical
            developments, holes...history is not easily changed.
