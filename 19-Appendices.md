 19.4. Appendix -- Glossary
   19.4.1. **Comments**
           - Release Note: I regret that I haven't had time to add many
              new entries here. There are a lot of specialized terms, and
              I probably could have doubled the number of entries here.
           - Much more work is needed here. In fact, I debated at one
              point making the FAQ instead into a kind of "Encycopedia
              Cypherpunkia," with a mix of short and long articles on
              each of hundreds of topics. Such an organization would
              suffer the disadvantages found in nearly all
              lexicographically-organized works: confusion of the
              concepts.
           - Many of the these entries were compiled for a long handout
              at the first Cypherpunks meeting, September, 1992. Errors
              are obviously present. I'll try to keep correcting them
              when I can.
           - Schneier's "Applied Cryptography" is of course an excellent
              place to browse for terms, special uses, etc.
   19.4.2. agoric systems -- open, free market systems in which
            voluntary transactions are central.
   19.4.3. Alice and Bob -- crypographic protocols are often made
            clearer by considering parties A and B, or Alice and Bob,
            performing some protocol. Eve the eavesdropper, Paul the
            prover, and Vic the verifier are other common stand-in names.
   19.4.4. ANDOS -- all or nothing disclosure of secrets.
   19.4.5. anonymous credential -- a credential which asserts some right
            or privelege or fact without revealing the identity of the
            holder.  This is unlike CA driver's licenses.
   19.4.6. assymmetric cipher -- same as public key cryptosystem.
   19.4.7. authentication -- the process of verifying an identity or
            credential, to ensure you are who you said you were.
   19.4.8. biometric security -- a type of authentication using
            fingerprints, retinal scans, palm prints, or other
            physical/biological signatures of an individual.
   19.4.9. bit commitment -- e.g., tossing a coin and then committing to
            the value without being able to change the outcome. The blob
            is a cryptographic primitive for this.
  19.4.10. BlackNet -- an experimental scheme devised by T. May to
            underscore the nature of anonymous information markets. "Any
            and all" secrets can be offered for sale via anonymous
            mailers and message pools. The experiment was leaked via
            remailer to the Cypherpunks list (not by May) and thence to
            several dozen Usenet groups by Detweiler. The authorities are
            said to be investigating it.
  19.4.11. blinding, blinded signatures -- A signature that the signer
            does not remember having made.  A blind signature is always a
            cooperative protocol and the receiver of the signature
            provides the signer with the blinding information.
  19.4.12. blob -- the crypto equivalent of a locked box. A
            cryptographic primitive for bit commitment, with the
            properties that a blobs can represent a 0 or a 1, that others
            cannot tell be looking whether it's a 0 or a 1, that the
            creator of the blob can "open" the blob to reveal the
            contents, and that no blob can be both a 1 and a 0. An
            example of this is a flipped coin covered by a hand.
  19.4.13. BnD --
  19.4.14. Capstone --
  19.4.15. channel -- the path over which messages are transmitted.
            Channels may be secure or insecure, and may have
            eavesdroppers (or enemies, or disrupters, etc.) who alter
            messages, insert and delete messages, etc. Cryptography is
            the means by which communications over insecure channels are
            protected.
  19.4.16. chosen plaintext attack -- an attack where the cryptanalyst
            gets to choose the plaintext to be enciphered, e.g., when
            possession of an enciphering machine or algorithm is in the
            possession of the cryptanalyst.
  19.4.17. cipher -- a secret form of writing, using substitution or
            transposition of characters or symbols. (From Arabic "sifr,"
            meaning "nothing.")
  19.4.18. ciphertext -- the plaintext after it has been encrypted.
  19.4.19. Clipper -- the infamous Clipper chip
  19.4.20. code -- a restricted cryptosystem where words or letters of a
            message are replaced by other words chosen from a codebook.
            Not part of modern cryptology, but still useful.
  19.4.21. coin flippping -- an important crypto primitive, or protocol,
            in which the equivalent of flipping a fair coin is possible.
            Implemented with blobs.
  19.4.22. collusion -- wherein several participants cooperate to deduce
            the identity of a sender or receiver, or to break a cipher.
            Most cryptosystems are sensitive to some forms of collusion.
            Much of the work on implementing DC Nets, for example,
            involves ensuring that colluders cannot isolate message
            senders and thereby trace origins and destinations of mail.
  19.4.23. COMINT --
  19.4.24. computationally secure -- where a cipher cannot be broken
            with available computer resources, but in theory can be
            broken with enough computer resources. Contrast with
            unconditionally  secure.
  19.4.25. countermeasure -- something you do to thwart an attacker
  19.4.26. credential -- facts or assertions about some entity. For
            example, credit ratings, passports, reputations, tax status,
            insurance records, etc.  Under the current system, these
            credentials are increasingly being cross-linked. Blind
            signatures may be used to create anonymous credentials.
  19.4.27. credential clearinghouse  -- banks, credit agencies,
            insurance companies, police departments, etc., that correlate
            records and decide the status of records.
  19.4.28. cryptanalysis -- methods for attacking and breaking ciphers
            and related cryptographic systems. Ciphers may be broken,
            traffic may be analyzed, and passwords may be cracked.
            Computers are of course essential.
  19.4.29. crypto anarchy -- the economic and political system after the
            deployment of encryption, untraceable e-mail, digital
            pseudonyms, cryptographic voting, and digital cash. A pun on
            "crypto," meaning "hidden," and as when Gore Vidal called
            William F. Buckley a "crypto fascist."
  19.4.30. cryptography -- another name for cryptology.
  19.4.31. cryptology -- the science and study of writing, sending,
            receiving, and deciphering secret messages. Includes
            authentication, digital signatures, the hiding of messages
            (steganography), cryptanalysis, and several other fields.
  19.4.32. cyberspace  -- the electronic domain, the Nets, and computer-
            generated spaces. Some say it is the "consensual reality"
            described in "Neuromancer." Others say it is the phone
            system. Others have work to do.
  19.4.33. DC protocol, or DC-Net -- the dining cryptographers protocol.
            DC-Nets use multiple participants communicating with the DC
            protocol.
  19.4.34. DES -- the Data Encryption Standard, proposed in 1977 by the
            National Bureau of Standards (now NIST), with assistance from
            the National Security Agency. Based on the "Lucifer" cipher
            developed by Horst Feistel at IBM, DES is a secret key
            cryptosystem that cycles 64-bit blocks of data through
            multiple permutations with a 56-bit key controlling the
            routing. "Diffusion" and "confusion" are combined to form a
            cipher that has not yet been cryptanalyzed (see "DES,
            Security of"). DES is in use for interbank transfers, as a
            cipher inside of several RSA-based systems, and is available
            for PCs.
  19.4.35. DES, Security of  -- many have speculated that the NSA placed
            a trapdoor (or backdoor) in DES to allow it to read DES-
            encrypted messages. This has not been proved. It is known
            that the original Lucifer algorithm used a 128-bit key and
            that this key length was shortened to 64 bits (56 bits plus 8
            parity bits), ths making exhaustive search much easier (so
            far as is known, brute-force search has not been done, though
            it should be feasible today). Shamir and Bihan have used a
            technique called "differential cryptanalysis" to reduce the
            exhaustive search needed for chosen plaintext attacks (but
            with no import for ordinary DES).
  19.4.36. differential cryptanalysis -- the Shamir-Biham technique for
            cryptanalyzing DES. With a chosen plaintext attack, they've
            reduced the number of DES keys that must be tried from about
            2^56 to about 2^47 or less. Note, however, that rarely can an
            attacker mount a chosen plaintext attack on DES systems.
  19.4.37. digital cash, digital money -- Protocols for transferring
            value, monetary or otherwise, electronically.  Digital cash
            usually refers to systems that are anonymous. Digital money
            systems can be used to implement any quantity that is
            conserved, such as points, mass, dollars, etc.  There are
            many variations of  digital money systems, ranging from VISA
            numbers to blinded signed digital coins.  A topic too large
            for a single glossary entry.
  19.4.38. digital pseudonym -- basically, a "crypto identity." A way
            for individuals to set up accounts with various organizations
            without revealing more information than they wish. Users may
            have several digital pseudonyms, some used only once, some
            used over the course of many years. Ideally, the pseudonyms
            can be linked only at the will of the holder. In the simplest
            form, a public key can serve as a digital pseudonym and need
            not be linked to a physical identity.
  19.4.39. digital signature --  Analogous to a written signature on a
            document. A modification to a message that only the signer
            can make but that everyone can recognize.  Can  be used
            legally to contract at a distance.
  19.4.40. digital timestamping -- one function of a digital notary
            public, in which some message (a song, screenplay, lab
            notebook, contract, etc.) is stamped with a time that cannot
            (easily) be forged.
  19.4.41. dining cryptographers protocol (aka DC protocol, DC nets) --
            the untraceable message sending system invented by David
            Chaum. Named after the "dining philosophers" problem in
            computer science, participants form circuits and pass
            messages in such a way that the origin cannot be deduced,
            barring collusion. At the simplest level, two participants
            share a key between them. One of them sends some actual
            message by bitwise exclusive-ORing the message with the key,
            while the other one just sends the key itself. The actual
            message from this pair of participants is obtained by XORing
            the two outputs. However, since nobody but the pair knows the
            original key, the actual message cannot be traced to either
            one of the participants.
  19.4.42. discrete logarithm problem -- given integers a, n, and x,
            find some integer m such that a^m mod n = x, if m exists.
            Modular exponentiation, the a^m mod n part, is
            straightforward (and special purpose chips are available),
            but the inverse problem is believed to be very hard, in
            general.  Thus it is conjectured that modular exponentiation
            is a one-way function.
  19.4.43. DSS, Digital Signature Standard -- the latest NIST (National
            Institute of Standards and Technology, successor to NBS)
            standard for digital signatures. Based on the El Gamal
            cipher, some consider it weak and poor substitute for RSA-
            based signature schemes.
  19.4.44. eavesdropping, or passive wiretapping -- intercepting
            messages without detection. Radio waves may be intercepted,
            phone lines may be tapped, and computers may have RF
            emissions detected. Even fiber optic lines can be tapped.
  19.4.45. Escrowed Encryption Standard (EES) -- current name for the
            key escrow system known variously as Clipper, Capstone,
            Skipjack, etc.
  19.4.46. factoring -- Some large numbers are difficult to factor. It
            is conjectured that there are no feasible--i.e."easy," less
            than exponential in size of number-- factoring methods. It is
            also an open problem whether RSA may be broken more easily
            than by factoring the modulus (e.g., the public key might
            reveal information which simplifies the problem).
            Interestingly, though factoring is believed to be "hard", it
            is not known to be in the class of NP-hard problems.
            Professor Janek invented a factoring device, but he is
            believed to be fictional.
  19.4.47. HUMINT --
  19.4.48. information-theoretic security -- "unbreakable" security, in
            which no amount of cryptanalysis can break a cipher or
            system. One time pads are an example (providing the pads are
            not lost nor stolen nor used more than once, of course). Same
            as unconditionally secure.
  19.4.49. key -- a piece of information needed to encipher or decipher
            a message. Keys may be stolen, bought, lost, etc., just as
            with physical keys.
  19.4.50. key exchange, or key distribution -- the process of sharing a
            key with some other party, in the case of symmetric ciphers,
            or of distributing a  public key in an asymmetric cipher. A
            major issue is that the keys be exchanged reliably and
            without compromise. Diffie and Hellman devised one such
            scheme, based on the discrete logarithm problem.
  19.4.51. known-plaintext attack -- a cryptanalysis of a cipher where
            plaintext-ciphertext pairs are known. This attack searches
            for an unknown key. Contrast with the chosen plaintext
            attack, where the cryptanalyst can also choose the plaintext
            to be enciphered.
  19.4.52. listening posts -- the NSA and other intelligence agencies
            maintain sites for the interception of radio, telephone, and
            satellite communications. And so on. Many sites have been
            identified (cf.  Bamford), and many more sites are suspected.
  19.4.53. mail, untraceable  -- a system for sending and receiving mail
            without traceability or observability. Receiving mail
            anonymously can be done with broadcast of the mail in
            encrypted form.  Only the intended recipient (whose identity,
            or true name, may be unknown to the sender) may able to
            decipher the message. Sending mail anonymously apparently
            requires mixes or use of the dining cryptographers (DC)
            protocol.
  19.4.54. Message Pool
  19.4.55. minimum disclosure proofs  -- another name for zero knowledge
            proofs, favored by Chaum.
  19.4.56. mixes -- David Chaum's term for a box which performs the
            function of mixing, or decorrelating, incoming and outgoing
            electronic mail messages. The box also strips off the outer
            envelope (i.e., decrypts with its private key) and remails
            the message to the address on the inner envelope. Tamper-
            resistant modules may be used to prevent cheating and forced
            disclosure of the mapping between incoming and outgoing mail.
            A sequence of many remailings effectively makes tracing
            sending and receiving impossible. Contrast this with the
            software version, the DC protocol. The "remailers" developed
            by Cypherpunks are an approximation of a Chaumian mix.
  19.4.57. modular exponentiation  -- raising an integer to the power of
            another integer, modulo some integer. For integers a, n, and
            m, a^m mod n. For example, 5^3 mod 100 = 25. Modular
            exponentiation can be done fairly quickly with a sequence of
            bit shifts and adds, and special purpose chips have been
            designed. See also discrete logarithm.
  19.4.58. National Security Agency (NSA)  -- the largest intelligence
            agency, responsible for making and breaking ciphers, for
            intercepting communications, and for ensuring the security of
            U.S. computers. Headquartered in Fort Meade, Maryland, with
            many listening posts around the world.  The NSA funds
            cryptographic research and advises other agencies about
            cryptographic matters. The NSA once obviously had the world's
            leading cryptologists, but this may no longer be the case.
  19.4.59. negative credential -- a credential that you possess that you
            don't want any one else to know, for example, a bankruptcy
            filing.  A formal version of a negative reputation.
  19.4.60. NP-complete -- a large class of difficult problems.  "NP"
            stands for nondeterministic polynomial time, a class of
            problems thought in general not to have feasible algorithms
            for their solution.  A problem is "complete"  if  any other
            NP problem may be reduced to that problem.   Many important
            combinatorial and algebraic problems are NP-complete: the
            travelling salesman problem, the Hamiltonian cycle problem,
            the graph isomorphism problem, the word problem, and on and
            on.
  19.4.61. oblivious transfer -- a cryptographic primitive that involves
            the probablistic transmission of bits. The sender does not
            know if the bits were received.
  19.4.62. one-time pad -- a string of randomly-selected bits or symbols
            which is combined with a plaintext message to produce the
            ciphertext. This combination may be shifting letters some
            amount, bitwise exclusive-ORed, etc.). The recipient, who
            also has a copy of the one time pad, can easily recover the
            plaintext. Provided the pad is only used once and then
            destroyed, and is not available to an eavesdropper, the
            system is perfectly secure, i.e., it is information-
            theoretically secure. Key distribution (the pad)  is
            obviously a practical concern, but consider CD-ROM's.
  19.4.63. one-way function -- a function which is easy to compute in
            one direction but hard to find any inverse for, e.g. modular
            exponentiation, where the inverse problem is known as the
            discrete logarithm problem. Compare the special case of trap
            door one-way functions.  An example of  a one-way operation
            is multiplication: it is  easy to multiply two prime numbers
            of 100 digits to produce a 200-digit number, but  hard to
            factor that 200-digit number.
  19.4.64. P ?=? NP  -- Certainly the most  important unsolved problem
            in complexity theory. If P = NP, then cryptography as we know
            it today does not exist.  If P = NP,  all NP problems are
            "easy."
  19.4.65. padding -- sending extra messages to confuse eavesdroppers
            and to defeat traffic analysis.   Also adding random bits to
            a message to be enciphered.
  19.4.66. PGP
  19.4.67. plaintext -- also called cleartext, the text that is to be
            enciphered.
  19.4.68. Pool
  19.4.69. Pretty Good Privacy (PGP)  -- Phillip Zimmerman's
            implementation of RSA, recently upgraded to version 2.0, with
            more robust components and several new features. RSA Data
            Security has threatened PZ so he no longer works on it.
            Version 2.0 was written by a consortium of non-U.S. hackers.
  19.4.70. prime numbers -- integers with no factors other than
            themselves and 1. The number of primes is unbounded.  About
            1% of the 100 decimal digit numbers are prime.  Since there
            are about 10^70 particles in the universe, there are about
            10^23  100 digit primes for each and every particle in the
            universe!
  19.4.71. probabalistic encryption  -- a scheme by Goldwasser, Micali,
            and Blum that allows multiple ciphertexts for the same
            plaintext, i.e., any given plaintext may have many
            ciphertexts if the ciphering is repeated. This protects
            against certain types of known ciphertext attacks on RSA.
  19.4.72. proofs of identity -- proving who you are, either your true
            name, or your digital identity. Generally, possession of the
            right key is sufficient proof (guard your key!). Some work
            has been done on "is-a-person" credentialling agencies, using
            the so-called Fiat-Shamir protocol...think of this as a way
            to issue unforgeable digital passports. Physical proof of
            identity may be done with biometric security methods. Zero
            knowledge proofs of identity reveal nothing beyond the fact
            that the identity is as claimed. This has obvious uses for
            computer access, passwords, etc.
  19.4.73. protocol -- a formal procedure for solving some problem.
            Modern cryptology is mostly about the study of protocols for
            many problems, such as coin-flipping, bit commitment (blobs),
            zero knowledge proofs, dining cryptographers, and so on.
  19.4.74. public key -- the key distributed publicly to potential
            message-senders. It may be published in a phonebook-like
            directory or otherwise sent. A major concern is the validity
            of this public key to guard against spoofing or
            impersonation.
  19.4.75. public key cryptosystem -- the modern breakthrough in
            cryptology, designed by Diffie and Hellman, with
            contributions from several others. Uses trap door one-way
            functions so that encryption may be done by anyone with
            access to the "public key" but decryption may be done only by
            the holder of the "private key." Encompasses public key
            encryption, digital signatures, digital cash, and many other
            protocols and applications.
  19.4.76. public key encryption -- the use of modern cryptologic
            methods to provided message security and authentication. The
            RSA algorithm is the most widely used form of public key
            encryption, although other systems exist. A public key may be
            freely published, e.g., in phonebook-like directories, while
            the corresponding private key is closely guarded.
  19.4.77. public key patents  -- M.I.T. and Stanford, due to the work
            of Rivest, Shamir, Adleman, Diffie, Hellman, and Merkle,
            formed Public Key Partners to license the various public key,
            digital signature, and RSA patents. These patents, granted in
            the early 1980s, expire in the between 1998 and 2002. PKP has
            licensed RSA Data Security Inc., of Redwood City, CA, which
            handles the sales, etc.
  19.4.78. quantum cryptography -- a system based on quantum-mechanical
            principles. Eavesdroppers alter the quantum state of the
            system and so are detected. Developed by Brassard and
            Bennett, only small laboratory demonstrations have been made.
  19.4.79. remailers -- software versions of Chaum's "mixes," for the
            sending of untraceable mail. Various features are needed to
            do this: randomized order of resending, encryption at each
            stage (picked in advance by the sender, knowing the chain of
            remailers), padding of message sizes. The first remailer was
            written by E. Hughes in perl, and about a dozen or so are
            active now, with varying feature sets.
  19.4.80. reputations -- the trail of positive and negative
            associations and judgments that some entity accrues. Credit
            ratings, academic credentials, and trustworthiness are all
            examples. A digital pseudonym will accrue these reputation
            credentials based on actions, opinions of others, etc. In
            crypto anarchy, reputations and agoric systems will be of
            paramount importance. There are many fascinating issues of
            how reputation-based systems work, how credentials can be
            bought and sold, and so forth.
  19.4.81. RSA -- the main public key encryption algorithm, developed by
            Ron Rivest, Adi Shamir, and Kenneth Adleman. It exploits the
            difficulty of factoring large numbers to create a private key
            and public key. First invented in 1978, it remains the core
            of modern public key systems. It is usually much slower than
            DES, but special-purpose modular exponentiation chips will
            likely speed it up. A popular scheme for speed is to use RSA
            to transmit session keys and then a high-speed cipher like
            DES for the actual message text.
           - Description -- Let p and q be large primes, typically with
              more than 100 digits. Let n = pq and find some e such that
              e is relatively prime to (p - 1)(q - 1). The set of numbers
              p, q, and e is the private key for RSA. The set of numbers
              n and e forms the public key (recall that knowing n is not
              sufficient to easily find p and q...the factoring problem).
              A message M is encrypted by computing M^e mod n. The owner
              of the private key can decrypt the encrypted message by
              exploiting number theory results, as follows. An integer d
              is computed such that ed =1 (mod (p - 1)(q - 1)). Euler
              proved a theorem that M^(ed) = M mod n and so M^(ed) mod n
              = M. This means that in some sense the integers e and d are
              "inverses" of each other. [If this is unclear, please see
              one of the many texts and articles on public key
              encryption.]
  19.4.82. secret key cryptosystem -- A system which uses the same key
            to encrypt and decrypt traffic at each end of a communication
            link.  Also called a symmetric or one-key system.  Contrast
            with public key cryptosystem.
  19.4.83. SIGINT --
  19.4.84. smart cards -- a computer chip embedded in credit card.  They
            can hold cash, credentials, cryptographic keys, etc. Usually
            these are built with some degree of tamper-resistance. Smart
            cards may perform part of a crypto transaction, or all of it.
            Performing part of it may mean checking the computations of a
            more powerful computer, e.g., one in an ATM.
  19.4.85. spoofing, or masquerading -- posing as another user. Used for
            stealing passwords, modifying files, and  stealing cash.
            Digital signatures and other authentication methods are
            useful to prevent this. Public keys must be validated and
            protected to ensure that others don't subsititute their own
            public keys which users may then unwittingly use.
  19.4.86. steganography -- a part of cryptology dealing with hiding
            messages and obscuring who is sending and receiving messages.
            Message traffic is often padded to reduce the signals that
            would otherwise come from a sudden beginning of messages.
            "Covered writing."
  19.4.87. symmetric cipher -- same as private key cryptosystem.
  19.4.88. tamper-responding modules, tamper-resistant modules (TRMs) --
            sealed boxes or modules which are hard to open, requiring
            extensive probing and usually leaving ample evidence that the
            tampering has occurred. Various protective techniques are
            used, such as special metal or oxide layers on chips, armored
            coatings, embedded optical fibers, and other measures to
            thwart analysis. Popularly called "tamper-proof boxes." Uses
            include: smart cards, nuclear weapon initiators,
            cryptographic key holders, ATMs, etc.
  19.4.89. tampering, or active wiretapping -- intefering with messages
            and possibly modifying them. This may compromise data
            security, help to break ciphers, etc.  See also spoofing.
  19.4.90. Tessera
  19.4.91. token -- some representation, such as ID cards, subway
            tokens, money, etc., that indicates possession of some
            property or value.
  19.4.92. traffic analysis -- determining who is sending or receiving
            messages by analyzing packets, frequency of packets, etc. A
            part of steganography. Usually handled with traffic padding.
  19.4.93. traffic analysis -- identifying characteristics of a message
            (such as sender, or destination) by watching traffic.
            Remailers and encryption help to foil traffic analysys.
  19.4.94. transmission rules -- the protocols for determining who can
            send messages in a DC protocol, and when. These rules are
            needed to prevent collision and deliberate jamming of the
            channels.
  19.4.95. trap messages -- dummy messages in DC Nets which are used to
            catch jammers and disrupters. The messages contain no private
            information and are published in a blob beforehand so that
            the trap message can later be opened to reveal the disrupter.
            (There are many strategies to explore here.)
  19.4.96. trap-door -- In cryptography, a piece of secret information
            that allows the holder of a private key to invert a normally
            hard to invert function.
  19.4.97. trap-door one way functions -- functions which are easy to
            compute in both the forward and reverse direction but for
            which the disclosure of an algorithm to compute the function
            in the forward direction does not provide information on how
            to compute the function in the reverse direction. More simply
            put, trap-door one way functions are one way for all but the
            holder of the secret information. The RSA algorithm is the
            best-known example of such a function.
  19.4.98. unconditional security -- same as information-theoretic
            security, that is, unbreakable except by loss or theft of the
            key.
  19.4.99. unconditionally  secure -- where no amount of intercepted
            ciphertext is enough to allow the cipher to be broken, as
            with the use of a one-time pad cipher. Contrast with
            computationally secure.
 19.4.100. URLs
 19.4.101. voting, cryptographic -- Various schemes have been devised
            for anonymous, untraceable voting. Voting schemes should have
            several properties: privacy of the vote, security of the vote
            (no multiple votes), robustness against disruption by jammers
            or disrupters, verifiability (voter has confidence in the
            results), and efficiency.
 19.4.102. Whistleblowers
 19.4.103. zero knowledge proofs -- proofs in which no knowledge of the
            actual proof is conveyed. Peggy the Prover demonstrates to
            Sid the Skeptic that she is indeed in possession of some
            piece of knowledge without actually revealing any of that
            knowledge. This is useful for access to computers, because
            eavesdroppers or dishonest sysops cannot steal the knowledge
            given. Also called minimum disclosure proofs. Useful for
            proving possession of some property, or credential, such as
            age or voting status, without revealing personal information.

                better-featured, has a Windows interface, is a device
                driver, and is robust. The disadvantages are that it
                currently does not ship with source code and uses a more
                obscure cipher.

                This is false.  PGP 2.6ui is available to US and Canadian
                residents.
                It is definitely legal for such people to download PGP
                2.6ui and study
                it.
                
                However, RSADSI claim that *using* PGP 2.6ui in the US
                and Canada
                violates their patents on the RSA algorithm and on public
                key
                cryptography in general.  Other people (like myself)
                believe that
                these patents wouldn't stand up if tested in court, and
                that in any
                case the damages recoverable would be zero.
                
                You might also like to know that the output formats
                generated by 2.6ui
                and MIT-2.6 are identical, so that if you choose to use
                2.6ui in North
                America noone will be able to tell the difference anyway.
                
                Unfortunately these patent problems have caused many
                North American
                FTP sites to stop carrying 2.3a and 2.6ui, for fear of
                committing
                contributory infringement.
                
                If you would like to examine PGP 2.3a or 2.6ui, they are
                available on
                many FTP sites.  Try

                IDEA cipher-feedback mode with a 255 character pass
                phrase, encrypts both the data and resource forks of
                files, and will encrypt the contents of a folder or
                volume in a single operation. Source code is provided,
                natch. CE is System 7 only....(Note that this program has

                encryption methods, just so nobody gets confused...)" [

             - Carl Ellison says "I've only used RIPEM on AOL -- but it
                should be the same....I run on a Mac, generating the
                armored file, and then use AOL's "paste from file" option
                in the File menu to include the encrypted file in the
                body of my message.....In the other direction, I have to
                use Select All and Copy to get it out of AOL mail, Paste
                to get it into an editor.  From there I can file it and
                give that file to PGP or RIPEM.....BBEDIT on the Mac has
                good support for RIPEM.  I wish I knew how to write
                BBEDIT extensions for Mac PGP as well." [C.E., 1994-07-

           - "Use a library.  That's a place with lots of paper
              periodicals and paper books.  Library materials not online,
              mostly, but it is still where most of the world's encoded
              knowledge is stored.  If you don't   like paper, tough.
              That's the way the world is right now." [Eric Hughes, 1994-

 19.8. A comment on software versions, ftp sites, instructions, etc.
   19.8.1. I regret that I can't be complete in all versions, platforms
            supported, sites for obtaining, instructions,
            incompatibilities, etc. Frankly, I'm drowning in reports of
            new versions, questions about use, etc. Most of these
            versions I have no direct knowledge of, have no experience
            with, and no appreciation of subtle incompatibilites
            involved.
   19.8.2. There are others who have concentrated on providing up-to-
            date reports on what is available. Some of them are"
           - site
   19.8.3. Reading sci.crypt, alt.security.pgp, and related groups for a
            few weeks and looking for programs of interest to one's own
            situation should give the most recent and current results.
            Things are moving quickly, so if one is interested in
            "AmigaPGP," for example, then the right place to look for the
            latest versions is in the groups just mentioned, or in groups
            and ftp sites specific to the Amiga. (Be careful that
            sabotaged or spoofed versions are not used, as in all crypto.
            "Joe's AmigaPGP" might need a closer look.)
