  9.2. SUMMARY: Policy: Clipper,Key Escrow, and Digital Telephony
    9.2.1. Main Points
           - Clipper has been a main unifying force, as 80% of all
              Americans, and 95% of all computer types, are opposed.
           - "Big Brother Inside"
    9.2.2. Connections to Other Sections
           - the main connections are _legal_
           - some possible implications for limits on crypto
    9.2.3. Where to Find Additional Information
           - There have been hundreds of articles on Clipper, in nearly
              all popular magazines. Many of these were sent to the
              Cypherpunks  list and may be available in the archives. (I
              have at least 80 MB of Cypherpunks list stuff, a lot of it
              newspaper and magazine articles on Clipper!)
           + more Clipper information can be found at:
             - "A good source is the Wired Online Clipper Archive. Send
                e-mail to info-rama@wired.com. with no subject and the
                words 'get help' and 'get clipper/index' in the body of
                the message." [students@unsw.EDU.AU, alt.privacy.clipper,
                1994-09-01]
    9.2.4. Miscellaneous Comments
           - As with a couple of other sections, I won't try to be as
              complete as some might desire. Just too many thousands of
              pages of stuff to consider.
  
  9.3. Introduction
    9.3.1. What is Clipper?
           - government holds the skeleton keys
           - analogies to other systems
    9.3.2. Why do most Cypherpunks oppose Clipper?
           - fear of restrictions on crypto, derailing so many wonderful
              possibilities
    9.3.3. Why does Clipper rate its own section?
           - The announcement of the "Escrowed Encryption Standard,"
              EES, on April 16, 1993, was a galvanizing event for
              Cypherpunks and for a large segment of the U. S.
              population. The EES was announced originally as "Clipper,"
              despite the use of the name Clipper by two major products
              (the Intergraph CPU and a dBase software tool), and the
              government backed off on the name. Too late, though, as the
              name "Clipper" had become indelibly linked to this whole
              proposal.
    9.3.4. "Is stopping Clipper the main goal of Cypherpunks?"
           - It certainly seems so at times, as Clipper has dominated
              the topics since the Clipper announcement in April, 1993.
           + it has become so, with monkeywrenching efforts in several
              areas
             - lobbying and education against it (though informal, such
                lobbying has been successful...look at NYT article)
             - "Big Brother Inside" and t-shirts
             - technical monkeywrenching (Matt Blaze...hesitate to claim
                any credit, but he has been on our list, attended a
                meeting, etc.)
           - Although it may seem so, Clipper is just one
              aspect...step...initiative.
           - Developing new software tools, writing code, deploying
              remailers and digital cash are long-range projects of great
              importance.
           - The Clipper key escrow proposal came along (4-93) at an
              opportune time for Cypherpunks and became a major focus.
              Emergency meetings, analyses, etc.
  
  9.4. Crypto Policy Issues
    9.4.1. Peter Denning on crypto policy:
           + provided by Pat Farrell, 1994-08-20; Denning comments are
              1992-01-22, presented at Computers, Freedom, and Privacy 2.
              Peter D. uses the metaphor of a "clearing,"as in a forest,
              for the place where people meet to trade, interact, etc.
              What others call markets, agoras, or just "cyberspace."
             - "Information technology in producing a clearing in which
                individuals and corporations are key players besides
                government. Any attempt by government to control the flow
                of information over networks will be ignored or met with
                outright hostility.  There is no practical way that
                government can control information except information
                directly involved in the business of governing.  It
                should not try." [Peter Denning, PUBLIC POLICY FOR THE
                21ST CENTURY, DRAFT 1/22/92]
           - No word on how this view squares with his wife's control
              freak views.
    9.4.2. Will government and NSA in particular attempt to acquire some
            kind of control over crypto companies?
           + speculations, apparently unfounded, that RSA Data Security
              is influenced by NSA wishes
             - weaknesses in the DES keys picked?
           - and companies may be dramatically influenced by contracts
              (and the witholding of them)
    9.4.3. NIST and DSS
    9.4.4. Export restrictions, Munitions List, ITAR
    9.4.5. old crypto machines sold to Third World governments, cheaply
           - perhaps they think they can make some changes and outsmart
              the NSA (which probably has rigged it so any changes are
              detectable and can be factored in)
           - and just knowing the type of machine is a huge advantage
    9.4.6. 4/28/97   The first of several P-K and RSA patents expires
           + U.S. Patent Number: 4200770
             - Title: Cryptographic Apparatus and Method
             - Inventors: Hellman, Diffie, Merkle
             - Assignee: Stanford University
             - Filed: September 6, 1977
             - Granted: April 29, 1980
             - [Expires: April 28, 1997]
           + remember that any one of these several patents held by
              Public Key Partners (Stanford and M.I.T., with RSA Data
              Security the chief dispenser of licenses) can block an
              effort to bypass the others
             - though this may get fought out in court
    9.4.7. encryption will be needed inside computer systems
           - for operating system protection
           - for autonomous agents (active agents)
           - for electronic money
  
  9.5. Motivations for Crypto Laws
    9.5.1. "What are the law enforcement and FBI worries?"
           - "FBI Director Louis Freeh is worried. The bad guys are
              beginning to see the light, and it is digital. ... Freeh
              fears some pretty nasty folks have discovered they can
              commit highway robbery and more, without even leaving home.
              Worse, to Freeh and other top cops, by using some pretty
              basic technologies, savvy criminals can do their crimes
              without worrying about doing time.
              
              "Some crooks, spies, drug traffickers, terrorists and
              frauds already use the tools of the information age to
              outfox law enforcement officers. Hackers use PBXs to hide
              their tracks as they rip off phone companies and poke
              around in other people's files. Reprogrammed cellular
              phones give cops fits." [LAN Magazine,"Is it 1984?," by Ted
              Bunker, August 1994]
           - Their fears have some validity...in the same way that the
              rulers in Gutenberg's time could have some concerns about
              the implications of books (breaking of guilds, spread of
              national secrets, pornography, atheism, etc.).
    9.5.2. "What motivated Clipper? What did the Feds hope to gain?"
           - ostensibly to stop terrorists (only the unsophisticated
              ones, if alternatives are allowed)
           - to force a standard on average Americans
           - possibly to limit crypto development
           + Phil Karn provides an interesting motivation for Clipper:
              "Key escrow exists only because the NSA doesn't want to
              risk blame if some terrorist or drug dealer were to use an
              unescrowed NSA-produced .....The fact that a terrorist or
              drug dealer can easily go elsewhere and obtain other strong
              or stronger algorithms without key escrow is irrelevant.
              The NSA simply doesn't care as long as *they* can't be
              blamed for whatever happens. Classic CYA, nothing
              more.....A similar analysis applies to the export control
              regulations regarding cryptography." [Phil Karn, 1994-08-
              31]
             - Bill Sommerfeld notes: "If this is indeed the case, Matt
                Blaze's results should be particularly devastating to
                them." [B.S., 1994-09-01]
    9.5.3. Steve Witham has an interesting take on why folks like
            Dorothy Denning and Donn Parker support key escrow so
            ardently:
           - "Maybe people like Dot and Don think of government as a
              systems-administration sort of job.  So here they are,
              security experts advising the sys admins on things like...
              
              setting permissions
              allocating quotas
              registering users and giving them passwords.....
              deciding what utilities are and aren't available
              deciding what software the users need, and installing it
                       (grudgingly, based on who's yelling the loudest)
              setting up connections to other machines
              deciding who's allowed to log in from "foreign hosts"
              getting mail set up and running
              buying new hardware from vendors
              specifying the hardware to the vendors
              ...
              
              "These are the things computer security experts advise on.
              Maybe hammer experts see things as nails.
              
              "Only a country is not a host system owned and administered
              by the government, and citizens are not guests or users."
              [Steve Witham, Government by Sysadmin, 1994-03-23]
              
    9.5.4. Who would want to use key escrow?
    9.5.5. "Will strong crypto really thwart government plans?"
           - Yes, it will give citizens the basic capabilities that
              foreign governments have had for many years
           + Despite talk about codebreakes and the expertise of the
              NSA, the plain fact is that no major Soviet ciphers have
              been broken for many years
             + recall the comment that NSA has not really broken any
                Soviet systems in many years
               - except for the cases, a la the Walker case, where
                  plaintext versions are gotten, i.e., where human
                  screwups occurred
           - the image in so many novels of massive computers breaking
              codes is absurd: modern ciphers will not be broken (but the
              primitive ciphers used by so many Third World nations and
              their embassies will continue to be child's play, even for
              high school science fair projects...could be a good idea
              for a small scene, about a BCC student who has his project
              pulled)
    9.5.6. "Why does the government want short keys?"
           - Commercial products have often been broken by hackers. The
              NSA actually has a charter to help businesses protect their
              secrets; just not so strongly that the crypto is
              unbreakable by them. (This of course has been part of the
              tension between the two sides of the NSA for the past
              couple of decades.)
           + So why does the government want crippled key lengths?
             - "The question is: how do you thwart hackers while
                permitting NSA access? The obvious answer is strong
                algorithm(s) and relatively truncated keys." [Grady Ward,
                sci.crypt, 1994-08-15]
  
  9.6. Current Crypto Laws
    9.6.1. "Has crypto been restricted in countries other than the
            U.S.?"
           - Many countries have restrictions on civilian/private use of
              crypto. Some even insist that corporations either send all
              transmissions in the clear, or that keys be provided to the
              government. The Phillipines, for example. And certainly
              regimes in the Communists Bloc, or what's left of it, will
              likely have various laws restricting crypto. Possibly
              draconian laws....in many cultures, use of crypto is
              tantamount to espionage.
  
  9.7. Crypto Laws Outside the U.S.
    9.7.1. "International Escrow, and Other Nation's Crypto Policies?"
           - The focus throughout this document on U.S. policy should
              not lull non-Americans into complacency. Many nations
              already have more Draconian policies on the private use of
              encryption than the U.S. is even contemplating
              (publically). France outlaws private crypto, though
              enforcement is said to be problematic (but I would not want
              the DGSE to be on my tail, that's for sure). Third World
              countries often have bans on crypto, and mere possession of
              random-looking bits may mean a spying conviction and a trip
              to the gallows.
           + There are also several reports that European nations are
              preparing to fall in line behind the U.S. on key escrow
             - Norway
             - Netherlands
             - Britain
           + A conference in D.C. in 6/94, attended by Whit Diffie (and
              reported on to us at the 6/94 CP meeting) had internation
              escrow arrangements as a topic, with the crypto policy
              makers of NIST and NSA describing various options
             - bad news, because it could allow bilateral treaties to
                supercede basic rights
             - could be plan for getting key escrow made mandatory
             + there are also practical issues
               + who can decode international communications?
                 - do we really want the French reading Intel's
                    communications? (recall Matra-Harris)
               - satellites? (like Iridium)
               - what of multi-national messages, such as an encrypted
                  message posted to a message pool on the Internet...is
                  it to be escrowed with each of 100 nations?
    9.7.2. "Will foreign countries use a U.S.-based key escrow system?"
           - Lots of pressure. Lots of evidence of compliance.
    9.7.3. "Is Europe Considering Key Escrow?"
           - Yes, in spades. Lots of signs of this, with reports coming
              in from residents of Europe and elsewhere. The Europeans
              tend to be a bit more quiet in matters of public policy (at
              least in some areas).
           - "The current issue of `Communications Week International'
              informs us that the European Union's Senior Officials Group
              for Security of Information Systems has been considering
              plans for standardising key escrow in Europe.
              
              "Agreement had been held up by arguments over who should
              hold the keys. France and Holland wanted to follow the
              NSA's lead and have national governments assume this role;
              other players wanted user organisations to do this." [
              rja14@cl.cam.ac.uk (Ross Anderson), sci.crypt, Key Escrow
              in Europe too, 1994-06-29]
    9.7.4. "What laws do various countries have on encryption and the
            use of encryption for international traffic?"
           + "Has France really banned encryption?"
             - There are recurring reports that France does not allow
                unfettered use of encryption.
             - Hard to say. Laws on the books. But no indications that
                the many French users of PGP, say, are being prosecuted.
             - a nation whose leader, Francois Mitterand, was a Nazi
                collaborationist, working with Petain and the Vichy
                government (Klaus Barbie involved)
           + Some Specific Countries
             - (need more info here)
             + Germany
               - BND cooperates with U.S.
             - Netherlands
             - Russia
           + Information
             - "Check out the ftp site at csrc.ncsl.nist.gov for a
                document named something like "laws.wp"  (There are
                several of these, in various formats.)  This  contains a
                survey of the positions of various countries, done for
                NIST by a couple of people at Georgetown or George
                Washington or some such university." [Philip Fites,
                alt.security.pgp, 1994-07-03]
    9.7.5. France planning Big Brother smart card?
           - "PARIS, FRANCE, 1994 MAR 4 (NB) -- The French government
              has confirmed its plans to replace citizen's paper-based ID
              cards with credit card-sized "smart card" ID cards.
              .....
              "The cards contain details of recent transactions, as well
              as act  as an "electronic purse" for smaller value
              transactions using a personal identification number (PIN)
              as authorization. "Purse transactions" are usually separate
              from the card credit/debit system, and, when the purse is
              empty, it can be reloaded from the card at a suitable ATM
              or retailer terminal."  (Steve Gold/19940304)" [this was
              forwarded to me for posting]
    9.7.6. PTTs, local rules about modem use
    9.7.7. "What are the European laws on "Data Privacy" and why are
            they such a terrible idea?"
           - Various European countries have passed laws about the
              compiling of computerized records on people without their
              explicit permission. This applies to nearly all
              computerized records--mailing lists, dossiers, credit
              records, employee files, etc.--though some exceptions exist
              and, in general, companies can find ways to compile records
              and remain within the law.
           - The rules are open to debate, and the casual individual who
              cannot afford lawyers and advisors, is likely to be
              breaking the laws repeatedly. For example, storing the
              posts of people on the Cypherpunks list in any system
              retrievable by name would violate Britain's Data Privacy
              laws. That almost no such case would ever result in a
              prosecution (for practical reasons) does not mean the laws
              are acceptable.
           - To many, these laws are a "good idea." But the laws miss
              the main point, give a false sense of security (as the real
              dossier-compilers are easily able to obtain exemptions, or
              are government agencies themselves), and interfere in what
              people do with information that properly and legally comes
              there way. (Be on the alert for "civil rights" groups like
              the ACLU and EFF to push for such data privacy laws. The
              irony of Kapor's connection to Lotus and the failed
              "Marketplace" CD-ROM product cannot be ignored.)
           - Creating a law which bans the keeping of certain kinds of
              records is an invitation to having "data inspectors"
              rummaging through one's files. Or some kind of spot checks,
              or even software key escrow.
           - (Strong crypto makes these laws tough to enforce. Either
              the laws go, or the counties with such laws will then have
              to limit strong crypto....not that that will help in the
              long run.)
           - The same points apply to well-meaning proposals to make
              employer monitoring of employees illegal. It sounds like a
              privacy-enhancing idea, but it tramples upon the rights of
              the employer to ensure that work is being done, to
              basically run his business as he sees fit, etc. If I hire a
              programmer and he's using my resources, my network
              connections, to run an illegal operation, he exposes my
              company to damages, and of course he isn't doing the job I
              paid him to do. If the law forbids me to monitor this
              situation, or at least to randomly check, then he can
              exploit this law to his advantage and to my disadvantage.
              (Again, the dangers of rigid laws, nonmarket
              solutions,(lied game theory.)

           + Matthew Gream [M.Gream@uts.edu.au] informed us that the
              export situation in Oz is just as best as in the U.S. [1994-
              09-06] (as if we didn't know...much as we all like to dump
              on Amerika for its fascist laws, it's clear that nearly all
              countries are taking their New World Order Marching Orders
              from the U.S., and that many of them have even more
              repressive crypto laws alredy in place...they just don't
              get the discussion the U.S. gets, for apparent reasons)
             - "Well, fuck that for thinking I was living under a less
                restrictive regime -- and I can say goodbye to an
                international market for my software.]
             - (I left his blunt language as is, for impact.)
    9.7.9. "For those interested, NIST have a short document for FTP,
            'Identification & Analysis of Foreign Laws & Regulations
            Pertaining to the Use of Commercial Encryption Products for
            Voice & Data Communications'. Dated Jan 1994." [Owen Lewis,
            Re: France Bans Encryption, alt.security.pgp, 1994-07-07]
  
  9.8. Digital Telephony
    9.8.1. "What is Digital Telephony?"
           - The Digital Telephony Bill, first proposed under Bush and
              again by Clinton, is in many ways much worse than Clipper.
              It has gotten less attention, for various reasons.
           - For one thing,  it is seen as an extension by some of
              existing wiretap capabilities. And, it is fairly abstract,
              happening behind the doors of telephone company switches.
           - The implications are severe: mandatory wiretap and pen
              register (who is calling whom) capaibilities, civil
              penalties of up to $10,000 a day for insufficient
              compliance, mandatory assistance must be provided, etc.
           - If it is passed, it could dictate future technology. Telcos
              who install it will make sure that upstart technologies
              (e.g., Cypherpunks who find ways to ship voice over
              computer lines) are also forced to "play by the same
              rules." Being required to install government-accessible tap
              points even in small systems would of course effectively
              destroy them.
           - On the other hand, it is getting harder and harder to make
              Digital Telephony workable, even by mandate. As Jim
              Kallstrom of the FBI puts it:  ""Today will be the cheapest
              day on which Congress could fix this thing," Kallstrom
              said. "Two years from now, it will be geometrically more
              expensive.""  [LAN Magazine,"Is it 1984?," by Ted Bunker,
              August 1994]
           - This gives us a goal to shoot for: sabotage the latest
              attempt to get Digital Telephony passed into law and it may
              make it too intractable to *ever* be passed.
           + "Today will be the cheapest day on which
             - Congress could fix this thing," Kallstrom said. "Two
                years from now,
             - it will be geometrically more expensive."
           - The message is clear: delay Digital Telephony. Sabotage it
              in the court of public opinion, spread the word, make it
              flop. (Reread your "Art of War" for Sun Tsu's tips on
              fighting your enemy.)
           -
    9.8.2. "What are the dangers of the Digital Telephony Bill?"
           - It makes wiretapping invisible to the tappee.
           + If passed into law, it makes central office wiretapping
              trivial, automatic.
             - "What should worry people is what isn't in the news (and
                probably never will until it's already embedded in comm
                systems). A true 'Clipper' will allow remote tapping on
                demand. This is very easily done to all-digital
                communications systems. If you understand network routers
                and protocol it's easy to envision how simple it would be
                to 're-route' a copy of a target comm to where ever you
                want it to go..."  [domonkos@access.digex.net (andy
                domonkos), comp.org.eff.talk, 1994-06-29]
    9.8.3. "What is the Digital Telephony proposal/bill?
           - proposed a few years ago...said to be inspiration for PGP
           - reintroduced Feb 4, 1994
           - earlier versrion:
           + "1)  DIGITAL TELEPHONY PROPOSAL
             - "To ensure law enforcement's continued ability to conduct
                court-

             - legislation.  The version submitted to Congress in Sept.

             - and private branch exchange (PBX) operators to ensure
                that the
             - government's ability to lawfully intercept communications
                is not
             - curtailed or prevented entirely by the introduction of
                advanced
             - technology."
  
  9.9. Clipper, Escrowed Encyption Standard
    9.9.1. The Clipper Proposal
           - A bombshell was dropped on April 16, 1993. A few of us saw
              it coming, as we'd been debating...
    9.9.2. "How long has the government been planning key escrow?"
           - since about 1989
           - ironically, we got about six months advance warning
           - my own "A Trial Balloon to Ban Encryption" alerted the
              world to the thinking of D. Denning....she denies having
              known about key escorw until the day before it was
              announced, which I find implausible (not calling her a
              liar, but...)
           + Phil Karn had this to say to Professor Dorothy Denning,
              several weeks prior to the Clipper announcement:
             - "The private use of strong cryptography provides, for the
                very first time, a truly effective safeguard against this
                sort of government abuse. And that's why it must continue
                to be free and unregulated.
             - "I should credit you for doing us all a very important
                service by raising this issue. Nothing could have lit a
                bigger fire under those of us who strongly believe in a
                citizens' right to use cryptography than your proposals
                to ban or regulate it.  There are many of us out here who
                share this belief *and* have the technical skills to turn
                it into practice. And I promise you that we will fight
                for this belief to the bitter end, if necessary." [Phil
                Karn, 1993-03-23]
             -
             -
    9.9.3. Technically, the "Escrowed Encryption Standard," or EES. But
            early everyone still calls it "Clipper, " even if NSA
            belatedly realized Intergraph's won product has been called
            this for many years, a la the Fairchild processor chip of the
            same name. And the database product of the same name. I
            pointed this out within minutes of hearing about this on
            April 16th, 1993, and posted a comment to this effect on
            sci.crypt. How clueless can they be to not have seen in many
            months of work what many of us saw within seconds?
    9.9.4. Need for Clipper
    9.9.5. Further "justifications" for key escrow
           + anonymous consultations that require revealing of
              identities
             - suicide crisis intervention
             - confessions of abuse, crimes, etc. (Tarasoff law)
           - corporate records that Feds want to look at
           + Some legitimate needs for escrowed crypto
             - for corporations, to bypass the passwords of departed,
                fired, deceased employees,
    9.9.6. Why did the government develop Clipper?
    9.9.7. "Who are the designated escrow agents?"
           - Commerce (NIST) and Treasury (Secret Service).
    9.9.8. Whit Diffie
           - Miles Schmid was architect
           + international key escrow
             - Denning tried to defend it....
    9.9.9. What are related programs?
   9.9.10. "Where do the names "Clipper" and "Skipjack" come from?
           - First, the NSA and NIST screwed up big time by choosing the
              name "Clipper," which has long been the name of the 32-bit
              RISC processor (one of the first) from Fairchild, later
              sold to Intergraph. It is also the name of a database
              compiler. Most of us saw this immediately.
           -
           + Clippers are boats, so are skipjacks ("A small sailboat
              having a
             - bottom shaped like a flat V and vertical sides" Am
                Heritage. 3rd).
             - Suggests a nautical theme, which fits with the
                Cheseapeake environs of
             - the Agency (and small boats have traditionally been a way
                for the
             + Agencies to dispose of suspected traitors and spies).
               -
             - However, Capstone is not a boat, nor is Tessera, so the
                trend fails.
 
 9.10. Technical Details of Clipper, Skipjack, Tessera, and EES
   9.10.1. Clipper chip fabrication details
           + ARM6 core being used
             - but also rumors of MIPS core in Tessera
           - MIPS core reportedly being designed into future versions
           - National also built (and may operate) a secure wafer fab
              line for NSA, reportedly located on the grounds of Ft.
              Meade--though I can't confirm the location or just what
              National's current involvement still is. May only be for
              medium-density chips, such as key material (built under
              secure conditions).
   9.10.2. "Why is the Clipper algorithm classified?"
           - to prevent non-escrow versions, which could still use the
              (presumably strong) algorithm and hardware but not be
              escrowed
           - cryptanalysis is always easier if the algorithms are known
              :-}
           - general government secrecy
           - backdoors?
   9.10.3. If Clipper is flawed (the Blaze LEAF Blower), how can it
            still be useful to the NSA?
           - by undermining commercial alternatives through subsidized
              costs (which I don't think will happen, given the terrible
              PR Clipper has gotten)
           - mandated by law or export rules
           - and the Blaze attack is--at present--not easy to use (and
              anyone able to use it is likely to be sophisticated enough
              to use preencryption anyway)
   9.10.4. What about weaknesses of Clipper?
           - In the views of many, a flawed approach. That is, arguing
              about wrinkles plays into the hands of the Feds.
   9.10.5. "What are some of the weaknesses in Clipper?"
           - the basic idea of key escrow is an infringement on liberty
           + access to the keys
             - "
             + "There's a big door in the side with a
               - big neon sign saying "Cops and other Authorized People
                  Only";
               - the trapdoor is the fact that anybody with a fax
                  machine can make

   9.10.6. Mykotronx
           - MYK-78e chip, delays, VTI, fuses
           - National Semiconductor is working with Mykotronx on a
              faster implementation of the
              Clipper/Capstone/Skipjack/whatever system. (May or may not
              be connected directly with the iPower product line.  Also,
              the MIPS processor core may be used, instead of the ARM
              core, which is said to be too slow.)
   9.10.7. Attacks on EES
           - sabotaging the escrow data base
           + stealing it, thus causing a collapse in confidence
             - Perry Metzger's proposal
           - FUD
   9.10.8. Why is the algorithm secret?
   9.10.9. Skipjack is 80 bits, which is 24 bits longer than the 56 bits
            of DES. so
  9.10.10. "What are the implications of the bug in Tessera found by
            Matt Blaze?"
           - Technically, Blaze's work was done on a Tessera card, which
              implements the Skipjace algorithm. The Clipper phone system
              may be slightly different and details may vary; the Blaze
              attack may not even work, at least not practically.
           - " The announcement last month was about a discovery that,
              with a half-hour or so of time on an average PC, a user
              could forge a bogus LEAF (the data used by the government
              to access the back door into Clipper encryption). With such
              a bogus LEAF, the Clipper chip on the other end would
              accept and decrypt the communication, but the back door
              would not work for the government." [ Steve Brinich,
              alt.privacy.clipper, 1994-07-04]
           - "The "final" pre-print version (dated August 20, 1994) of
              my paper, "Protocol Failure in the Escrowed Encryption
              Standard" is now available.  You can get it in PostScript
              form via anonymous ftp from research.att.com in the file
              /dist/mab/eesproto.ps .  This version replaces the
              preliminary draft (June 3) version that previously occupied
              the same file.  Most of the substance is identical,
              although few sections are expanded and a few minor errors
              are now corrected." [Matt Blaze, 1994-09-04]
 
 9.11. Products, Versions -- Tessera, Skipjack, etc.
   9.11.1. "What are the various versions and products associated with
            EES?"
           - Clipper, the MYK-78 chip.
           - Skipjack.
           + Tessera. The PCMCIA card version of the Escrowed Encryption
              Standard.
             - the version Matt Blaze found a way to blow the LEAF
             - National Semiconductor "iPower" card may or may not
                support Tessera (conflicting reports).
   9.11.2. AT&T Surety Communications
           - NSA may have pressured them not to release DES-based
              products
   9.11.3. Tessera cards
           - iPower
           - Specifications for the Tessera card interface can be found
              in several places, including " csrc.ncsl.nist.gov"--see the
              file  cryptcal.txt [David Koontz, 1994-08-08].
 
 9.12. Current Status of EES, Clipper, etc.
   9.12.1. "Did the Administration really back off on Clipper? I heard
            that Al Gore wrote a letter to Rep. Cantwell, backing off."
           - No, though Clipper has lost steam (corporations weren't
              interested in buying Clipper phones, and AT&T was very late
              in getting "Surety" phones out).
           - The Gore announcement may actually indicate a shift in
              emphasis to "software key escrow" (my best guess).
           - Our own Michael Froomkin, a lawyer, writes:  "The letter is
              a nullity.  It almost quotes from testimony given a year
              earlier by NIST to Congress.  Get a copy of Senator Leahy's
              reaction off the eff www  server.  He saw it for the empty
              thing it is....Nothing has changed except Cantwell dropped
              her bill for nothing." [A.Michael Froomkin,
              alt.privacy.clipper, 1994-09-05]
 
 9.13. National Information Infrastructure, Digital Superhighway
   9.13.1. Hype on the Information Superhighway
           - It's against the law to talk abou the Information
              Superhighway without using at least one of the overworked
              metaphors: road kill, toll boths, passing lanes, shoulders,
              on-ramps, off-ramps, speeding, I-way, Infobahn, etc.
           - Most of what is now floating around the suddenly-trendy
              idea of the Digital Superduperway is little more than hype.
              And mad metaphors. Misplaced zeal, confusing tangential
              developments with real progress. Much like libertarians
              assuming the space program is something they should somehow
              be working on.
           - For example, the much-hyped "Pizza Hut" on the Net (home
              pizza pages, I guess). It is already being dubbed "the
              first case of true Internet commerce." Yeah, like the Coke
              machines on the Net so many years ago were examples of
              Internet commerce. Pure hype. Madison Avenue nonsense. Good
              for our tabloid generation.
   9.13.2. "Why is the National Information Infrastructure a bad idea?"
           - NII = Information Superhighway = Infobahn = Iway = a dozen
              other supposedly clever and punning names
           + Al Gore's proposal:
             - links hospitals, schools, government
             + hard to imagine that the free-wheeling anarchy of the
                Internet would persist..more likely implications:
               - "is-a-person" credentials, that is, proof of identity,
                  and hence tracking, of all interactions
               - the medical and psychiatric records would be part of
                  this (psychiatrists are leery of this, but they may
                  have no choice but to comply under the National Health
                  Care plans being debated)
           + There are other bad aspects:
             - government control, government inefficiency, government
                snooping
             - distortion of markets ("universal access')
             - restriction of innovation
             - is not needed...other networks are doing perfectly well,
                and will be placed where they are needed and will be
                locally paid for
   9.13.3. NII, Video Dialtone
           + "Dialtone"
             - phone companies offer an in-out connection, and charge
                for the connection, making no rulings on content (related
                to the "Common Carrier" status)
             + for video-cable, I don't believe there is an analogous
                set-up being looked at
               + cable t.v.
                 - Carl Kadie's comments to Sternlight
   9.13.4. The prospects and dangers of Net subsidies
           - "universal access," esp. if same happens in health care
           - those that pay make the rules
           + but such access will have strings attached
             - limits on crypto
             -
           - universal access also invites more spamming, a la the
              "Freenet" spams, in which folks keep getting validated as
              new users: any universal access system that is not pay-as-
              you-go will be sensitive to this *or* will result in calls
              for universal ID system (is-a-person credentialling)
   9.13.5. NII, Superhighway, I-way
           - crypto policy
           - regulation, licensing
 
 9.14. Government Interest in Gaining Control of Cyberspace
   9.14.1. Besides Clipper, Digital Telephony, and the National
            Information Infrastructure, the government is interested in
            other areas, such as e-mail delivery (US Postal Service
            proposal) and maintenance of network systems in general.
   9.14.2. Digital Telephony, ATM networks, and deals being cut
           - Rumblings of deals being cut
           -  a new draft is out [John Gilmore, 1994-08-03]
           - Encryption with hardware at full ATM speeds
           - and SONET networks (experimental, Bay Area?)
   9.14.3. The USPS plans for mail, authentication, effects on
            competition, etc.
           + This could have a devastating effect on e-mail and on
              cyberspace in general, especially if it is tied in to other
              government proposals in an attempt to gain control of
              cyberspace.
             - Digital Telelphony, Clipper, pornography laws and age
                enforcement (the Amateur Action case), etc.
           + "Does the USPS really have a monopoly on first class mail?"
             - and on "routes"?
             - "The friendly PO has recently been visiting the mail
                rooms of 2) The friendly PO has recently been visiting
                the mail rooms of corporations in the Bay Area, opening
                FedX, etc. packages (not protected by the privacy laws of
                the PO's first class mail), and fining companies ($10,000
                per violation, as I recall), for sending non-time-
                sensitive documents via FedX when they could have been
                sent via first-class mail." [Lew Glendenning, USPS
                digital signature annoucement, sci.crypt, 1994-08-23] (A
                citation or a news story would make this more credible,
                but I've heard of similar spot checks.)
           - The problems with government agencies competing are well-
              known. First, they often have shoddy service..civil service
              jobs, unfireable workers, etc. Second, they often cannot be
              sued for nonperformance. Third, they often have government-
              granted monopolies.
           + The USPS proposal may be an opening shot in an attempt to
              gain control of electronic mail...it never had control of e-
              mail, but its monopoly on first-class mail may be argued by
              them to extend to cyberspace.
             - Note: FedEx and the other package and overnight letter
                carriers face various restrictions on their service; for
                example, they cannot offer "routes" and the economies
                that would result in.
             - A USPS takeover of the e-mail business would mean an end
                to many Cypherpunks objectives, including remailers,
                digital postage, etc.
             - The challenge will be to get these systems deployed as
                quickly as possible, to make any takeover by the USPS all
                the more difficult.
 
 9.15. Software Key Escrow
   9.15.1. (This section needs a lot more)
   9.15.2. things are happening fast....
   9.15.3. TIS, Carl Ellison, Karlsruhe
   9.15.4. objections to key escrow
           - "Holding deposits in real estate transactions is a classic
              example. Built-in wiretaps are *not* escrow, unless the
              government is a party to your contract.  As somebody on the
              list once said, just because the Mafia call themselves
              "businessmen" doesn't make them legitimate; calling
              extorted wiretaps "escrow" doesn't make them a service.
              
              "The government has no business making me get their
              permission to talk to anybody about anything in any
              language I choose, and they have no business insisting I
              buy "communication protection service" from some of their
              friends to do it, any more than the aforenamed
              "businessmen" have any business insisting I buy "fire
              insurance" from *them*." [Bill Stewart, 1994-07-24]
   9.15.5. Micali's "Fair Escrow"
           - various efforts underway
           - need section here
           - Note: participants at Karlsruhe Conference report that a
              German group may have published on software key escrow
              years before Micali filed his patent (reports that NSA
              officials were "happy")
 
 9.16. Politics, Opposition
   9.16.1. "What should Cypherpunks say about Clipper?"
           - A vast amount has been written, on this list and in dozens
              of other forums.
           - Eric Hughes put it nicely a while back:
           - "The hypothetical backdoor in clipper is a charlatan's
              issue by comparison, as is discussion of how to make a key
              escrow system
              'work.'  Do not be suckered into talking about an issue
              that is not
              important.  If someone want to talk about potential back
              doors, refuse to speculate.  The existence of a front door
              (key escrow) make back door issues pale in comparison.
              
              "If someone wants to talk about how key escrow works,
              refuse to
              elaborate.  Saying that this particular key escrow system
              is bad has a large measure of complicity in saying that
              escrow systems in general are OK.  Always argue that this
              particular key escrow system is bad because it is a key
              escrow system, not because it has procedural flaws.
              
              "This right issue is that the government has no right to my
              private communications.  Every other issue is the wrong
              issue and detracts from this central one.  If we defeat one
              particular system without defeating all other possible such
              systems at the same time, we have not won at all; we have
              delayed the time of reckoning." [ Eric Hughes, Work the
              work!, 1993-06-01]
   9.16.2. What do most Americans think about Clipper and privacy?"
           - insights into what we face
           + "In a Time/CNN poll of 1,000 Americans conducted last week
              by Yankelovich
             - Partners, two-thirds said it was more important to
                protect the privacy of phone
             - calls than to preserve the ability of police to conduct
                wiretaps.
             - When informed about the Clipper Chip, 80% said they
                opposed it."
             - Philip Elmer-Dewitt, "Who Should Keep the Keys", Time,
                Mar. 4, 1994
   9.16.3. Does anyone actually support Clipper?
           + There are actually legitimate uses for forms of escrow:
             - corporations
             - other partnerships
   9.16.4. "Who is opposed to Clipper?"
           - Association for Computing Machinery (ACM). "The USACM urges
              the Administration at this point to withdraw the Clipper
              Chip proposal and to begin an open and public review of
              encryption policy.  The escrowed encryption initiative
              raises vital issues of privacy, law enforcement,
              competitiveness and scientific innovation that must be
              openly discussed." [US ACM, DC Office" <usacm_dc@acm.org>,

              30]
   9.16.5. "What's so bad about key escrow?"
           + If it's truly voluntary, there can be a valid use for this.
             + Are trapdoors justified in some cases?
               + Corporations that wish to recover encrypted data
                 + several scenarios
                   - employee encrypts important files, then dies or is
                      otherwise unavailable
                   + employee leaves company before decrypting all files
                     - some may be archived and not needed to be opened
                        for many years
                   - employee may demand "ransom" (closely related to
                      virus extortion cases)
                   - files are found but the original encryptor is
                      unknown
               + Likely situation is that encryption algorithms will be
                  mandated by corporation, with a "master key" kept
                  available
                 - like a trapdoor
                 - the existence of the master key may not even be
                    publicized within the company (to head off concerns
                    about security, abuses, etc.)
               + Government is trying to get trapdoors put in
                 - S.266, which failed ultimately (but not before
                    creating a ruckus)
           + If the government requires it...
             - Key escrow means the government can be inside your home
                without you even knowing it
           - and key escrow is not really escrow...what does one get
              back from the "escrow" service?
   9.16.6. Why governments should not have keys
           - can then set people up by faking messages, by planting
              evidence
           - can spy on targets for their own purposes (which history
              tells us can include bribery, corporate espionage, drug-
              running, assassinations, and all manner of illegal and
              sleazy activities)
           - can sabotage contracts, deals, etc.
           - would give them access to internal corporate communications
           - undermines the whole validity of such contracts, and of
              cryptographic standards of identity (shakes confidence)
           - giving the King or the State the power to impersonate
              another is a gross injustice
           - imagine the government of Iran having a backdoor to read
              the secret journals of its subjects!
           - 4th Amendment
           - attorney-client privilege (with trapdoors, no way to know
              that government has not breached confidentiality)
   9.16.7. "How might the Clipper chip be foiled or defeated?"
           - Politically, market-wise, and technical
           - If deployed, that is
           + Ways to Defeat Clipper
             - preencryption or superencryption
             - LEAF blower
             - plug-compatible, reverse-engineered chip
             - sabotage
             - undermining confidence
             - Sun Tzu
   9.16.8. How can Clipper be defeated, politically?
   9.16.9. How can Clipper be defeated, in the market?
  9.16.10. How can Clipper be defeated, technologically?
  9.16.11. Questions
           + Clipper issues and questions
             - a vast number of questions, comments, challenges,
                tidbits, details, issues
             - entire newsgroups devoted to this
           + "What criminal or terrrorist will be smart enough to use
              encryption but dumb enough to use Clipper?"
             - This is one of the Great Unanswered Questions. Clipper's
                supporter's are mum on this one. Suggesting....
           + "Why not encrypt data before using the Clipper/EES?"
             - "Why can't you just encrypt data before the clipper chip?
                
                Two answers:
                
                1) the people you want to communicate with won't have
                hardware to
                   decrypt your data, statistically speaking.  The beauty
                of clipper
                   from the NSA point of view is that they are leveraging
                the
                   installed base (they hope) of telephones and making it
                impossible
                   (again, statistically) for a large fraction of the
                traffic to be
                   untappable.
                
                2) They won't license bad people like you to make
                equipment like the
                   system you describe.  I'll wager that the chip
                distribution will be
                   done in a way to prevent significant numbers of such
                systems from
                   being built, assuring that (1) remains true." [Tom
                Knight, sci.crypt, 6-5-93]
                
             -
           + What are the implications of mandatory key escrow?
             + "escrow" is misleading...
               - wrong use of the term
               - implies a voluntary, and returnable, situation
           + "If key escrow is "voluntary," what's the big deal?"
             - Taxes are supposedly "voluntary," too.
             - A wise man prepares for what is _possible_ and even
                _likely_, not just what is announced as part of public
                policy; policies can and do change. There is plenty of
                precedent for a "voluntary" system being made mandatory.
             - The form of the Clipper/EES system suggests eventual
                mandatory status; the form of such a ban is debatable.
           + "What is 'superencipherment,' and can it be used to defeat
              Clipper?"
             - preencrypting
             - could be viewed as a non-English language
             + how could Clipper chip know about it (entropy measures?)
               - far-fetched
             - wouldn't solve traffic anal. problem
           - What's the connection between Clipper and export laws?
           + "Doesn't this make the Clipper database a ripe target?"
             - for subversion, sabotage, espionage, theft
             - presumably backups will be kept, and _these_ will also be
                targets
           + "Is Clipper just for voice encryption?"
             - Clipper is a data encryption chip, with the digital data
                supplied by an ADC located outside the chip. In
                principle, it could thus be used for data encryption in
                general.
             - In practice, the name Clipper is generally associated
                with telephone use, while "Capstone" is the data standard
                (some differences, too). The "Skipjack" algorithm is used
                in several of these proposed systems (Tessera, also).
  9.16.12. "Why is Clipper worse than what we have now?"
           + John Gilmore answered this question in a nice essay. I'm
              including the whole thing, including a digression into
              cellular telephones, because it gives some insight--and
              names some names of NSA liars--into how NSA and NIST have
              used their powers to thwart true security.
             - "It's worse because the market keeps moving toward
                providing real encryption.
                
                "If Clipper succeeds, it will be by displacing real
                secure encryption. If real secure encryption makes it
                into mass market communications products, Clipper will
                have failed.  The whole point is not to get a few
                Clippers used by cops; the point is to make it a
                worldwide standard, rather than having 3-key triple-DES
                with RSA and Diffie-Hellman become the worldwide
                standard.
                
                "We'd have decent encryption in digital cellular phones
                *now*, except for the active intervention of Jerry
                Rainville of NSA, who `hosted' a meeting of the standards
                committee inside Ft. Meade, lied to them about export
                control to keep committee documents limited to a small
                group, and got a willing dupe from Motorola, Louis
                Finkelstein, to propose an encryption scheme a child
                could break.  The IS-54 standard for digital cellular
                doesn't describe the encryption scheme -- it's described
                in a separate document, which ordinary people can't get,
                even though it's part of the official accredited
                standard.  (Guess who accredits standards bodies though -
                - that's right, the once pure NIST.)
                
                "The reason it's secret is because it's so obviously
                weak.  The system generates a 160-bit "key" and then
                simply XORs it against each block of the compressed
                speech.  Take any ten or twenty blocks and recover the
                key by XORing frequent speech patterns (like silence, or
                the letter "A") against pieces of the blocks to produce
                guesses at the key.  You try each guess on a few blocks,
                and the likelihood of producing something that decodes
                like speech in all the blocks is small enough that you'll
                know when your guess is the real key.
                
                "NSA is continuing to muck around in the Digital Cellular
                standards committee (TR 45.3) this year too.  I encourage
                anyone who's interested to join the committee, perhaps as
                an observer.  Contact the Telecommunications Industry
                Association in DC and sign up.  Like any standards
                committee, it's open to the public and meets in various
                places around the country.  I'll lend you a lawyer if
                you're a foreign national, since the committee may still
                believe that they must exclude foreign nationals from
                public discussions of cryptography.  Somehow the crypto
                conferences have no trouble with this; I think it's
                called the First Amendment.  NSA knows the law here --
                indeed it enforces it via the State Dept -- but lied to
                the committee." [John Gilmore, "Why is clipper worse than

  9.16.13. on trusting the government
           - "WHAT AM THE MORAL OF THE STORY, UNCLE REMUS?....When the
              government makes any announcement (ESPECIALLY a denial),
              you should figure out what the government is trying to get
              you to do--and do the opposite.  Contrarianism with a
              vengance.  Of all the advice I've  offered on the
              Cypherpunks Channel, this is absolutely the most certain."
              [Sandy Sandfort, 1994-07-17]
           - if the Founders of the U.S. could see the corrupt,
              socialist state this nation has degenerated to, they'd be
              breaking into missile silos and stealing nukes to use
              against the central power base.
           + can the government be trusted to run the key escrow system?
             - "I just heard on the news that 1300 IRS employees have
                been disciplined for unauthorized accesses to
                electronically filed income tax returns.  ..I'm sure they
                will do much better, though, when the FBI runs the phone
                system, the Post Office controls digital identity and
                Hillary takes care of our health." [Sandy Sandfort, 1994-
                07-19]
             - This is just one of many such examples: Watergate ("I am
                not a crook!"), Iran-Contra, arms deals, cocaine
                shipments by the CIA, Teapot Dome, graft, payoffs,
                bribes, assassinations, Yankee-Cowboy War, Bohemian
                Grove, Casolaro, more killings, invasions, wars. The
                government that is too chicken to ever admit it lost a
                war, and conspicuously avoids diplomatic contact with
                enemies it failed to vanquish (Vietnam, North Korea,
                Cuba, etc.), while quickly becoming sugar daddy to the
                countries it did vanquish...the U.S. appears to be
                lacking in practicality. (Me, I consider it wrong for
                anyone to tell me I can't trade with folks in another
                country, whether it's Haiti, South Africa, Cuba, Korea,
                whatever. Crypto anarchy means we'll have _some_ of the
                ways of bypassing these laws, of making our own moral
                decisions without regard to the prevailing popular
                sentiment of the countries in which we live at the
                moment.)
 
 9.17. Legal Issues with Escrowed Encryption and Clipper
   9.17.1. As John Gilmore put it in a guest editorial in the "San
            Francisco Examiner," "...we want the public to see a serious
            debate about why the Constitution should be burned in order
            to save the country." [J.G., 1994-06-26, quoted by S.
            Sandfort]
   9.17.2. "I don't see how Clipper gives the government any powers or
            capabilities it doesn't already have.  Comments?"
   9.17.3. Is Clipper really voluntary?
   9.17.4. If Clipper is voluntary, who will use it?
   9.17.5. Restrictions on Civilian Use of Crypto
   9.17.6. "Has crypto been restricted in the U.S.?"
   9.17.7. "What legal steps are being taken?"
           - Zimmermann
           - ITAR
   9.17.8. reports that Department of Justice has a compliance
            enforcement role in the EES [heard by someone from Dorothy
            Denning, 1994-07], probably involving checking the law
            enforcement agencies...
   9.17.9. Status
           +  "Will government agencies use Clipper?"
             - Ah, the embarrassing question. They claim they will, but
                there are also reports that sensitive agencies will not
                use it, that Clipper is too insecure for them (key
                lenght, compromise of escrow data, etc.). There may also
                be different procedures (all agencies are equal, but some
                are more equal than others).
             - Clipper is rated for unclassified use, so this rules out
                many agencies and many uses. An interesting double
                standard.
           + "Is the Administration backing away from Clipper?"
             + industry opposition surprised them
               - groups last summer, Citicorp, etc.
             - public opinion
             - editorial remarks
             - so they may be preparing alternative
             - and Gilmore's FOIA, Blaze's attack, the Denning
                nonreview, the secrecy of the algortithm
           + will not work
             - spies won't use it, child pornographers probably won't
                use it (if alternatives exist, which may be the whole
                point)
             - terrorists won't use it
           - Is Clipper in trouble?
  9.17.10. "Will Clipper be voluntary?"
           - Many supporters of Clipper have cited the voluntary nature
              of Clipper--as expressed in some policy statements--and
              have used this to counter criticism.
           + However, even if truly voluntary, some issues
             + improper role for government to try to create a
                commercial standard
               - though the NIST role can be used to counter this point,
                  partly
             - government can and does make it tough for competitors
             - export controls (statements by officials on this exist)
           + Cites for voluntary status:
             - original statement says it will be voluntary
             - (need to get some statements here)
           + Cites for eventual mandatory status:
             - "Without this initiative, the government will eventually
                become helpless to defend the nation." [Louis Freeh,
                director of the FBI, various sources]
             - Steven Walker of Trusted Information Systems is one of
                many who think so: "Based on his analysis, Walker added,
                "I'm convinced that five years from now they'll say 'This
                isn't working,' so we'll have to change the rules." Then,
                he predicted, Clipper will be made mandatory for all
                encoded communications." [

 9.18. Concerns
   9.18.1. Constitutional Issues
           - 4th Amend
           - privacy of attorney-client, etc.
           + Feds can get access without public hearings, records
             - secret intelligence courts
             -
             + "It is uncontested (so far as I have read) that under
                certain circum-
               - stances, the Federal intelligence community wil be
                  permitted to
               - obtain Clipper keys without any court order on public
                  record.  Only
               - internal, classified proceedings will protect our
                  privacy." <Steve Waldman, steve@vesheu.sar.usf.edu,
                  sci.crypt, 4-13-94>
   9.18.2. "What are some dangers of Clipper, if it is widely adopted?"
           + sender/receiver ID are accessible without going to the key
              escrow
             - this makes traffic analysis, contact lists, easy to
                generate
           + distortions of markets ("chilling effects") as a plan by
              government
             - make alternatives expensive, hard to export, grounds for
                suspicion
             - use of ITAR to thwart alternatives (would be helped if
                Cantwell bill to liberalize export controls on
                cryptography  (HR 3627) passes)
             + VHDL implementations possible
               - speculates Lew Glendenning, sci.crypt, 4-13-94

   9.18.6. Skipjack
   9.18.7. National security exceptions
           - grep Gilmore's FOIA for mention that national security
              people will have direct access and that this will not be
              mentioned to the public
           + "The "National Security" exception built into the Clipper
              proposal
             - leaves an extraordinarily weak link in the chain of
                procedures designed
             - to protect user privacy.  To place awesome powers of
                surveillance
             - technologically within the reach of a few, hoping that so
                weak a chain
             - will bind them, would amount to dangerous folly.  It
                flies in the face
             - of history. <Steve Waldman, steve@vesheu.sar.usf.edu, 4-
                14-94, talk.politics.crypto>
   9.18.8. In my view, any focus on the details of Clipper instead of
            the overall concept of key escrow plays into their hands.
            This is not to say that the work of Blaze and others is
            misguided....in fact, it's very fine work. But a general
            focus on the _details_ of Skipjack does nothing to allay my
            concerns about the _principle_ of government-mandated crypto.
            
            If it were "house key escrow" and there were missing details
            about the number of teeth allowed on the keys, would be then
            all breathe a sigh of relief if the details of the teeth were
            clarified? Of course not. Me, I will never use a key escrow
            system, even if a blue ribbon panel of hackers and
            Cypherpunks studies the design and declares it to be
            cryptographically sound.
   9.18.9. Concern about Clipper
           - allows past communications to be read
           + authorities could--maybe--read a lot of stuff, even
              illegally, then use this for other investigations (the old
              "we had an anonymous tip" ploy)
             - "The problem with Clipper is that it provides police
                agencies with dramatically enhanced target acquistion.
                There is nothing to prevent NSA, ATF, FBI (or the Special
                Projects division of the Justice Department) from
                reviewing all internet traffic, as long as they are
                willing to forsake using it in a criminal prosecution."
                [dgard@netcom.com, alt.privacy.clipper, 1994-07-05]
  9.18.10. Some wags have suggested that the new escrow agencies be
            chosen from groups like Amnesty International and the ACLU.
            Most of us are opposed to the "very idea" of key escrow
            (think of being told to escrow family photos, diaries, or
            house keys) and hence even these kinds of skeptical groups
            are unacceptable as escrow agents.
 
 9.19. Loose Ends
   9.19.1. "Are trapdoors--or some form of escrowed encryption--
            justified in some cases?"
           + Sure. There are various reasons why individuals, companies,
              etc. may want to use crypto protocols that allow them to
              decrypt even if they've lost their key, perhaps by going to
              their lawyer and getting the sealed envelope they left with
              him, etc.
             - or using a form of "software key escrow" that allows them
                access
           + Corporations that wish to recover encrypted data
             + several scenarios
               - employee encrypts important files, then dies or is
                  otherwise unavailable
               + employee leaves company before decrypting all files
                 - some may be archived and not needed to be opened for
                    many years
               - employee may demand "ransom" (closely related to virus
                  extortion cases)
               - files are found but the original encryptor is unknown
           + Likely situation is that encryption algorithms will be
              mandated by corporation, with a "master key" kept available
             - like a trapdoor
             - the existence of the master key may not even be
                publicized within the company (to head off concerns about
                security, abuses, etc.)
           - The mandatory use of key escrow, a la a mandatory Clipper
              system, or the system many of us believe is being developed
              for software key escrow (SKE, also called "GAK," for
              "government access to keys, by Carl Ellison) is completely
              different, and is unacceptable. (Clipper is discussed in
              many places here.)
   9.19.2. DSS
           + Continuing confusion over patents, standards, licensing,
              etc.
             - "FIPS186 is DSS. NIST is of the opinion that DSS does not
                violate PKP's patents. PKP (or at least Jim Bidzos) takes
                the position that it does. But for various reasons, PKP
                won't sue the government. But Bidzos threatens to sue
                private parties who infringe. Stay tuned...." [Steve

             - even Taher ElGamal believes it's a weak standard
           - subliminal channels issues
   9.19.3. The U.S. is often hypocritical about basic rights
           - plans to "disarm" the Haitians, as we did to the Somalians
              (which made those we disarmed even more vulnerable to the
              local warlords)
           - government officials are proposing to "silence" a radio
              station in Ruanda they feel is sending out the wrong
              message! (Heard on "McNeil-Lehrer News Hour," 1994-07-21]
   9.19.4. "is-a-person" and RSA-style credentials
           + a dangerous idea, that government will insist that keys be
              linked to persons, with only one per person
             - this is a flaw in AOCE system
             - many apps need new keys generated many times
