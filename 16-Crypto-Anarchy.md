 16.2. SUMMARY: Crypto Anarchy
   16.2.1. Main Points
           - "...when you want to smash the State, everything looks like
              a hammer."
           - strong crypto as the "building material" for cyberspace
              (making the walls, the support beams, the locks)
   16.2.2. Connections to Other Sections
           - this section ties all the other sections together
   16.2.3. Where to Find Additional Information
           - again, almost nothing written on this
           - Vinge, Friedman, Rand, etc.
   16.2.4. Miscellaneous Comments
           - a very long section, possibly confusing to many
 
 16.3. Introduction
   16.3.1. "The revolution will not be televised. The revolution *will*,
            however, be digitized." Welcome to the New Underworld Order!
            (a term I have borrowed from writer Claire Sterling.)
   16.3.2. "Do the views here express the views of the Cypherpunks as a
            whole?"
           - This section is controversial. Hence, even more warnings
              than usual about being careful not to confuse these
              comments with the beliefs of all or even most Cypherpunks.
           - In fairness, libertarianism is undeniably the most
              represented ideology on the list, as it is in so much of
              the Net. The reasons for this have been extensively debated
              over the years, but it's a fact. If other major ideologies
              exists, they are fairly hidden on the Cypherpunks list.
           - Yes, some quasi-socialist views are occasionally presented.
              My friend Dave Mandl, for example, has at times argued for
              a less-anarchocapitalist view (but I think our views are
              actually fairly similar...he just has a different language
              and thinks there's more of a difference than their actually
              is--insert smiley here).
           - And several Cypherpunks who've thought about the issues of
              crypto anarchy have been disturbed by the conclusions that
              seem inevitable (markets for corporate information,
              assassianation made more liquid, data havens, espionage
              made much easier, and other such implications to be
              explored later in this section).
           - So, take this section with these caveats.
           - And some of the things I thing are inevitable, and in many
              cases positive, will be repugnant to some. The end of
              welfare, the end of subsidies of inner city breeders, for
              example. The smashing of the national security state
              through digital espionage, information markets, and
              selective assassinations are not things that everyone will
              take comfort in. Some may even call it illegal, seditious,
              and dangerous. So be it.
   16.3.3. "What are the Ideologies of Cyperpunks?"
           + I mentioned this in an earlier section, but now that I'm
              discussing "crypto anarchy" in detail it's good to recap
              some points about the ideology of Cypherpunks.
             - an area fraught with dangers, as many Cypherpunks have
                differing views of what's important
           + Two main foci for Cypherpunks:
             - Personal privacy in an increasingly watchful society
             - Undermining of states and governments
           - Of those who speak up, most seem to lean toward the
              libertarian position, often explicitly so (libertarians
              often are to be found on the Internet, so this correlation
              is not surprising)
           + Socialists and Communitarians
             - Should speak up more than they have. Dave Mandl is the
                only one I can recall who's given a coherent summary of
                his views.
           + My Personal Outlook on Laws and Ideology:
             - (Obviously also scattered thoughout this document.)
             + Non-coercion Principle
               - avoid initiation of physical aggression
               - "to each his own" (a "neo-Calvinist" perspective of
                  letting each person pick his path, and not interfering)
             - I support no law which can easily be circumvented.
                (Traffic laws are a counterexample...I generally agree
                with basic traffic laws....)
             - And I support no law I would not personally be willing to
                enforce and punish. Murder, rape, theft, etc, but not
                "victimless crimes, " not drug laws, and not 99.9998% of
                the laws on the books.
             - Crypto anarchy is in a sense a throwback to the pre-state
                days of individual choice about which laws to follow. The
                community exerted  a strong force.
             - With strong crypto ("fortress crypto," in law enforcement
                terms), only an intrusive police state can stop people
                from accessing "illegal" sites, from communicating with
                others, from using "unapproved" services, and so on. To
                pick one example, the "credit data haven" that keeps any
                and all financial records--rent problems from 1975,
                bankruptcy proceedings from 1983, divorce settlements,
                results from private investigators, etc. In the U.S.,
                many such records are "unusable": can't use credit data
                older than 7 years (under the "Fair Credit Reporting
                Act"), PI data, etc. But if I am thinking about lending
                Joe Blow some money, how the hell can I be told I can't
                "consider" the fact that he declared bankruptcy in 1980,
                ran out on his debts in Haiti in 1989, and is being sued
                for all his assets by two ex-wives? The answer is simple:
                any law which says I am not allowed to take into account
                information which comes my way is _flawed_ and should be
                bypassed. Dialing in to a credit haven in Belize is one
                approach--except wiretaps might still get me caught.
                Cyberspace allows much more convenient and secure
                bypasses of these laws.
           - (For those of you who think such bypasses of laws are
              immoral, tough. Strong crypto allows this. Get used to it.)
   16.3.4. Early history of crypto anarchy
           + 1987-8, AMIX, Salin, Manifesto
             - discussed crypto implications with Phil Salin and Gayle
                Pergamit, in December of 1987
             - with a larger group, including Marc Stiegler, Dave Ross,
                Jim Bennett, Phil Salin, etc., in June 1988.
             - released "The Crypto Anarchist Manifesto" in August 1988.
           - Fen LaBalme had "Guerillan Information Net" (GIN), which he
              and I discussed in 1988 at the Hackers Conference
           + "From Crossbows to Cryptography," 1987?
             - made similar points, but some important differences
           - TAZ also being written at this time
 
 16.4. The Crypto Anarchist Manifesto
   16.4.1. Unchanged since it's writing in mid-1988, except for my e-
            mail address.
           - There are some changes I'd make, but...
           - It was written quickly, and in a style to deliberately
              mimic what I remembered of the "Communist Manifesto." (for
              ironic reasons)
           - Still., I'm proud that more than six years ago I correctly
              saw some major points which Cypherpunks have helped to make
              happen: remailers, anonymous communictation, reputation-
              based systems, etc.
           - For history's sake, here it is:
   16.4.2.
            
            The Crypto Anarchist Manifesto
            
            Timothy  C.  May
            tcmay@netcom.com
            
            A specter is haunting the modern world, the specter of crypto
            anarchy.
            
            Computer technology is on the verge of providing the ability
            for individuals and groups to communicate and interact with
            each other in a totally anonymous manner. Two persons may
            exchange messages, conduct business, and negotiate electronic
            contracts without ever knowing the True Name, or legal
            identity, of the other. Interactions over networks will be
            untraceable, via extensive re-routing of encrypted packets
            and tamper-proof boxes which implement cryptographic
            protocols with nearly perfect assurance against any
            tampering. Reputations will be of central importance, far
            more important in dealings than even the credit ratings of
            today. These developments will alter completely the nature of
            government regulation, the ability to tax and control
            economic interactions, the ability to keep information
            secret, and will even alter the nature of trust and
            reputation.
            
            The technology for this revolution--and it surely will be
            both a social and economic revolution--has existed in theory
            for the past decade. The methods are based upon public-key
            encryption, zero-knowledge interactive proof systems, and
            various software protocols for interaction, authentication,
            and verification. The focus has until now been on academic
            conferences in Europe and the U.S., conferences monitored
            closely by the National Security Agency. But only recently
            have computer networks and  personal computers attained
            sufficient speed to make the ideas practically realizable.
            And the next ten years will bring enough additional speed to
            make the ideas economically feasible and essentially
            unstoppable. High-speed networks, ISDN, tamper-proof boxes,
            smart cards, satellites,  Ku-band transmitters, multi-MIPS
            personal computers, and encryption chips now under
            development will be some of the enabling technologies.
            
            The State will of course try to slow or halt the spread of
            this technology, citing national security concerns, use of
            the technology by drug dealers and tax evaders, and fears of
            societal disintegration. Many of these concerns will be
            valid; crypto anarchy will allow national secrets to be trade
            freely and will allow illicit and stolen materials to be
            traded. An anonymous computerized market will even make
            possible abhorrent markets for assassinations and extortion.
            Various criminal and foreign elements will be active users of
            CryptoNet. But this will not halt the spread of crypto
            anarchy.
            
            Just as the technology of printing altered and reduced the
            power of medieval guilds and the social power structure, so
            too will cryptologic methods fundamentally alter the nature
            of corporations
            and of government interference in economic transactions.
            Combined with emerging information markets, crypto anarchy
            will create a liquid market for any and all material which
            can be put into words and pictures. And just as a seemingly
            minor invention like barbed wire made possible the fencing-
            off of vast ranches and farms, thus altering forever the
            concepts of land and property rights in the frontier West, so
            too will the seemingly minor discovery out of an
            arcane branch of mathematics come to be the wire clippers
            which dismantle the barbed wire around intellectual property.
            
            Arise, you have nothing to lose but your barbed wire fences!
            
 
 16.5. Changes are Coming
   16.5.1. Technology is dramatically altering the nature of
            governments.
           - It may sound like newage trendiness, but strong crypto is
              "technological empowerment." It literally gives power to
              individuals. Like Sam Colt, it makes them equal.
           - "Politics has never given anyone lasting freedom, and it
              never will. Anything gained through politics will be lost
              again as soon as the society feels threatened. If most
              Americans have never been oppressed by the government
              (aside from an annual mugging) it is because most of them
              have never done anything to threaten the government's
              interests." [Mike Ingle, 1994-01-01]
           + Thesis: Strong crypto is a good thing
             - tool against governments of all flavors, left and right
             - religious freedom
             - personal choice
   16.5.2. Dangers of democracy in general and electronic democracy in
            particular
           - mob rule, rights of minority ignored
           - too many things get decided by vote that have no business
              being voted on
           - "don't tax me...", De Tocqueville's warning
           + electronic democracy is even worse
             - moves further from republican, representative system to
                electronc mob rule
             - too rapid a system
             - Detweiler's "electrocrasy" (spelling?)...brain-damaged,
                poorly thought-out
   16.5.3. The collapse of democracy is predicted by many
           + the "tipping factor" exceeded, with real taxation rates at
              50% or more in most developed countries, with conditions of
              "taxation without representation" far beyond anything in
              American colonial times
             - with professional politicians...and mostly millionaires
                running for office
             - the Cincinnatus (sp?) approach of going into government
                just for a few years, then returning to the farm or
                business, is a joke
           + rise of nominalism [argued by James Donald]
             - "After Athenian democracy  self destructed, the various
                warring parties found that they could only have peace if
                they disowned omnipotent government.  They put together a
                peace agreement that in part proclaimed limits to
                government,  in part acknowledged inherent limits to what
                was proper for governments to do  and in part guaranteed
                that the government would not go beyond what it was
                proper for government to do, that the majority could not
                do as it pleased with the minority, that not any act of
                power was a law, that law was not merely whatever the
                government willed.
                
                They did not agree on a constitution but agreed to
                respect an unwritten constitution that already existed in
                some sense.
                
                A similar arrangement underlies the American constitution
                (now defunct) and the English declaration of right (also
                defunct)
                
                The problem with such formal peace agreements is that
                they can only be put together after government has
                substantially collapsed.  Some of us wish to try other
                possibilities in the event of collapse.
                
                The American constitution collapsed because of the rise
                of nominalist theories "The constitution says whatever
                the courts say that it says." [James Donald, 1994-08-31]
           - War on Drugs, conspiracy charges, random searches,
              emergency preparedness orders (Operation Vampire Killer,
              Operation Night Train, REX-84). The killings of more than a
              dozen reporters and tipsters over the past decade, many of
              them covering the Iran-Contra story, the drug deals, the
              CIA's dealings...the Farm appears to be "swamping" more and
              more of these troublemakers in the headlong march toward
              fascism.
           + De Tocqueville's warning that the American experiment in
              democracy would last only until voters discovered they
              could pick the pockets of others at the ballot box
             - a point reached about 60 years ago
             - (prior to the federal income tax and then the "New Deal,"
                there were systemic limitations on this ability to the
                pockets of others, despite populist yearnings by
                some....after the New Deal, and the Great Society, the
                modern era of runaway taxation commenced.)
   16.5.4. Depredations of the State
           + "Discrimination laws"..choice no longer allowed
             - the strip club in LA forced to install wheelchair access-
                -for the dancers!
             - age no longer allowed to be a factor...gag!
           + democracy run rampant....worst fears of Founders
             - votes on everything...
           - gun control, seizures, using zoning laws (with FFL
              inspections as informants)
           - welfare state,...Murray, inner cities made worse...theft
           - "currency export" laws...how absurd that governments
              attempt to control what folks do with their own money!
   16.5.5. Things are likely to get worse, financially (a negative
            view,though there are also reasons to be optimistic)
           + a welfare state that is careening toward the edge of a
              cliff...escalating spending, constantly increasing national
              debt (with no signs that it will ever be paid down)
             - pension burdens are rising dramatically, according to
                "Economist", 1994-08.
           - the link to crypto is that folks had better find ways to
              immunize themselves from the coming crunch
           + Social Security, other pension plans are set to take 30-40%
              of all GDP
             - too many promies, people living longer
             - estimate: $20 trillion in "unfunded liabilities"
           - health care expectations... growing national debt
   16.5.6. Borders are becoming transparent to data...terabytes a day
            are flowing across borders, with thousands of data formats
            and virtually indistinguishable from other messages.
            Compressed files, split files, images, sounds, proprietary
            encryption formats, etc.  Once can _almost_ pity the NSA in
            the hopelessness of their job.
 
 16.6. Free Speech and Liberty--The Effects of Crypto
   16.6.1. "What freedom of speech is becoming."
           + An increased willingness to limit speech, by attaching
              restrictions based on it being "commercial" or "hate
              speech."
             + advertising laws being the obvious example: smoking,
                alcohol, etc.
               - doctors, lawyers, etc.
               - sex, nudity
               - even laws that say billboards can't show guns
           - A chilling but all too common sentiment on the Net is shown
              by this quote: "Is it freedom of speech to spew racism ,
              and steriotypes, just because you lack the intellectual
              capacity to comprehend that , perhaps, somewhere, there is
              a different way of life, which is not congruent with your
              pre-conceived notions?" [Andrew Beckwith, soc.culture.usa]
   16.6.2. We don't really have free speech
           - election laws
           - advertising laws
           + "slander" and "libel"
             - thankfully, anonymous systems will make this moot
           + permission needed...licensing, approval, certification
             - "qualifications"
             - granted, Supremes have made it clear that political
                comments cannot be restricted, but many other areas have
             - often the distinction involves 'for pay"
           - Perhaps you are thinking that these are not really examples
              of government censorship, just of _other crimes_  and
              _other rights_ taking precedence. Thus, advertisers can't
              make false or misleading claims, and can't advertise
              dangerous or otherwise unapproved items. And I can't make
              medical diagnoses, or give structural and geological
              advice, and so on...a dozen good examples. But these
              restrictions emasculate free speech, leaving only banal
              expression of appropriately-hedged "personal opinions" as
              the free speech that is allowed...and even that is ofen
              subject to crazy lawsuits and threats of legal action.
 
 16.7. The Nature of Anarchies
   16.7.1. Anarchy doesn't mean chaos and killing
           - As J. Bruce Dawson put it in a review of Linux in the
              September, 1994 "Byte," "It's anarchy at its best."
           + Ironically, crypto anarchy does admit the possibility (and
              hence probablility) of more contract killings as an
              ultimate enforcement mechanism for contracts otherwise
              unenforceable.
             - which is what is occurring in drug and other crime
                situaions: the parties cannot go to the police or courts
                for righting of wrongs, so they need to have the ultimate
                threat of death to enforce deals. It makes good sense
                from a reputation/game theory point of view.
   16.7.2. Leftists can be anarchists, too
           - In fact, this tends to be the popular interpretation of
              anarchy. (Besides the bomb-throwing, anti-Tsar anarchists
              of the 19th century, and the bomb-throwing anarchists of
              the U.S. early this century.)
           + "Temporary Autonomous Zones" (TAZ)
             - Hakim Bey (pseudonym for    )
             - Mondo 2000, books, (check with Dave Mandl, who helps to
                publish them)
   16.7.3. Anarchic development
           + Markets and emergent behaviors vs. planned development
             - principles of locality come into play (the local players
                know what they want and how much they'll pay for it)
             - central planners have "top-down" outlooks
             - Kevin Kelley's "Out of Control" (1994). Also, David
                Friedman's "Technologies of Freedom."
           - An example I heard about recently was Carroll College, in
              Wisconsin. Instead of building pathways and sidewalks
              across the newly-constructed grounds, the ground was left
              bare. After some time, the "emergent pathways" chosen by
              students and faculty were then turned into paved pathways,
              neatly solving the problem of people not using the
              "planned" pathways. I submit that much of life works this
              way. So does the Net (the "information footpaths"?).
           - anarchies are much more common than most people
              think...personal relationships, choices in life, etc.
   16.7.4. The world financial system is a good example: beyond the
            reach of any single government, even the U.S. New World
            Order, money moves and flows as doubts and concerns appear.
            Statist governments are powerless to stop the devaluation of
            their currencies as investors move their assets (even slight
            moves can have large marginal effects).
           - "anarchy" is not a term most would apply, but it's an
              anarchy in the sense of there being no rulers ("an  arch"),
              no central command structure.
 
 16.8. The Nature of Crypto Anarchy
   16.8.1. "What is Crypto Anarchy?"
           + "Why the name?"
             + a partial pun on several things"
               - "crypto," meaning "hidden," as used in the term "crypto
                  fascist" (Gore Vidal called William F. Buckley this)
               - "crypto anarchy" meaning the anarchy will be hidden,
                  not necessarily visible
               - and of course cryptology is centrally invovled
           + Motivation
             - Vernor Vinge's "True Names"
             - Ayn Rand was one of the prime motivators of crypto
                anarchy. What she wanted to do with material technology
                (mirrors over Galt's Gulch) is _much_ more easily done
                with mathematical technology.
   16.8.2. "Anarchy turns people off...why not a more palatable name?"
           - people don't understand the term; if people understood the
              term, it might be more acceptable
           - some have suggested I call it "digital liberty" or
              somesuch, but I prefer to stick with the historical term
   16.8.3. Voluntary interactions involve Schelling points, mutually-
            agreed upon points of agreement
   16.8.4. Crypto anarchy as an ideology rather than as a plan.
           - Without false modesty, I think crypto anarchy is one of the
              few real contributions to ideology in recent memory. The
              notion of individuals becoming independent of states by
              bypassing ordinary channels of control is a new one. While
              there have been hints of this in the cyberpunk genre of
              writing, and related areas (the works of Vinge especially),
              the traditional libertarian and anarchist movements have
              mostly been oblivious to the ramifications of strong
              crypto.
           - Interestingly, David Friedman, son of Milton and author of
              "The Machinery of Freedom," became a convert to the ideas.
              At least enough so as to give a talk in Los Angeles
              entitles "Crypto Anarchy and the State."
           - Conventional political ideology has failed to realize the
              huge changes coming over the next several decades.
              Focussing on unwinnable battles at the ballot box, they
              fritter away their energies; they join the political
              process, but they have nothing to "deal" with, so they
              lose. The average American actually _wants_ to pick the
              pockets of his neighbors (to pay for "free" health care, to
              stop companies from laying-off unneeded workers, to bring
              more pork back to the local enonomy), so the average voter
              is highly unlikely to ever vote for a prinicpled
              Libertarian candidate.
           - Fortunately, how people vote has little effect on certain
              "ground truths" that emerge out of new technologies and new
              economic developments.
 
 16.9. Uses of Crypto Anarchy
   16.9.1. Markets unfettered by local laws (digital black markets, at
            least for items that can be moved through cyberspace)
   16.9.2. Espionage

16.10. The Implications-Negative and Positive-of Crypto Anarchy
  16.10.1. "What are some implications of crypto anarchy?"
           + A return to contracts
             - whiners can't go outside contracts and complain
             - relates to: workers, terms of employment, actions, hurt
                feelings
             - with untraceable communication, virtual networks....
           + Espionage
             + Spying is already changing dramatically.
               + Steele's (or Steeler?) "open sources"
                 - collecting info from thousands of Internet sources
               - Well, this cuts both ways..
             + Will allow:
               - BlackNet-type solicitations for military secrets ("Will
                  pay $300,000 for xxxx")
               + Digital Dead Drops
                 - totally secure, untraceable (pools, BlackNet mode)
                 - no Coke cans near the base of oak trees out on Route
                    42
                 - no chalk marks on mailboxes to signal a message is
                    ready
                 - no "burning" of spies by following them to dead drops
                 - No wonder the spooks are freaked out!
             - Strong crypto will also have a major effect on NSA, CIA,
                and FBI abilities to wiretap, to conduct surveillance,
                and to do domestic and foreign counterintelligence
             - This is not altogether a great thing, as there may be
                _some_ counterintelligence work that is useful (I'm
                perhaps betraying my lingering biases), but there's
                really only one thing to say about it: get used to it.
                Nothing short of a totalitarian police state (and
                probably not even that, given the spread of strong
                crypto) can stop these trends.
             -
           + Bypassing sanctions and boycotts
             - Just because Bill Clinton doesn't like the rulers of
                Haiti is no reason for me to honor his "sanctions"
             - Individual choice, made possible by strong crypto
                (untraceable transactions, pseudonyms, black markets)
           + Information Markets and Data Havens
             - medical
             - scientific
             - corporate knowledge
             - dossiers
             + credit reports
               - without the absurd rules limiting what people can store
                  on their computers (e.g., if Alice keeps records going
                  back more than 7 years, blah blah, can be thrown in
                  jail for violating the "Fair Credit Reporting Act")
               - bypassing such laws
               - true, governments can attempt to force disclosure of
                  "reasons" for all decisions (a popular trend, where
                  even one's maid cannot be dismissed without the
                  "reasons" being called into question!); this means that
                  anyone accessing such offshore (or in cyberspace...same
                  difference) data bases must find some acceptable reason
                  for the actions they take...shouldn't be too hard
               - (as with so many of these ideas, the beauty is that the
                  using of such services is voluntary....)
           + Consulting
             - increased liquidity of information
             + illegal transactions
               + untraceability and digital money means many "dark"
                  possibilities
                 - markets for assassinations
                 - stolen property
                 - copyright infringement
           + Espionage
             - information markets (a la AMIX)
             - "digital dead drops"
           - Offshore accounts
           - Money-laundering
           + Markets for Assassinations
             - This is one of the more disturbing implications of crypto
                anarchy. Actually, it arises immediately out of strong,
                unbreakable and untraceable communication and some form
                of untraceable digital cash. Distrurbing it may be, but
                the implications are also interesting to consider...and
                inevitable.
             - And not all of the implications are wholly negative.
             + should put the fear of God into politicians
               - "Day of the Jackal" made electronic
               - any interest group that can (anonymously) gather money
                  can have a politician zapped. Positive and negative
                  implications, of course.
             - The fact is, some people simply need killing. Shocking as
                that may sound to many, surely everyone would agree that
                Hitler deserved killing. The "rule of law" sounds noble,
                but when despicable people control the law, other
                measures are called for.
             - Personally, I hold that anyone who threatens what I think
                of as basic rights may need killing. I am held back by
                the repercussions, the dangers. With liquid markets for
                liquidations, things may change dramatically.
  16.10.2. The Negative Side of Crypto Anarchy
           + Comment:
             - There are some very real negative implications;
                outweighed on the whole by the benefits. After all, free
                speech has negatives. Poronography has negatives. (This
                may not be very convincing to many....I can't do it here-
                -the gestalt has to be absorbed and considered.)
           + Abhorrent markets
             - contract killings
             - can collect money anonymously to have someone
                whacked...nearly anyone who is controversial can generate
                enough "contributions"
             - kidnapping, extortion
           + Contracts and assassinations
             - "Will kill for $5000"
             + provides a more "liquid" market (pun intended)
               - sellers and buyers more efficiently matched
               - FBI stings (which are common in hiring hit men) are
                  made almost impossible
             - the canonical "dark side" example--Eric Drexler, when
                told of this in 1988, was aghast and claimed I was
                immoral to even continue working on the implications of
                crypto anarchy!
             - made much easier by the inability to trace payments, the
                lack of physical meetings, etc.
           + Potential for lawlessness
             - bribery, abuse, blackmail
             - cynicism about who can manipulate the system
           + Solicitation of Crimes
             - untraceably, as we have seen
           + Bribery of Officials and Influencing of Elections
             - and direct contact with officials is not even
                needed...what if someone "lets it be known" that a
                council vote in favor of some desired project will result
                in campaign contributions?
           + Child molestors, pederasts, and rapists
             - encrypting their diaries with PGP (a real case, says the
                FBI)
             - this raises the privacy issue in all its glory...privacy
                protects illegality...it always has and it always will
           + Espionage is much easier
             - from the guy watching ships leave a harbor to the actual
                theft of defense secrets
             - job of defending against spies becomes much more
                difficult: and end to microdots and invisible ink, what
                with the LSB method and the like that even hides the very
                existence of encrypted messages!
           + Theft of information
             - from corporations and individuals
             - corporations as we know them today will have to change
             - liquidity of information
             - selling of corporate secrets, or personal information
           + Digilantes and Star Chambers
             - a risk of justice running amok?
             + Some killers are not rehabilitated and need to be
                disposed of through more direct means
               + Price, Rhode Island, 21, 4 brutal killings
                 - stabbings of children, mother, another
               + for animals like this, vigilantism...discreet
                  execution...is justified...
                 - or, at least some of us will consider it justified
                 - which I consider to be a good thing
               - this relates to an important theme: untraceable
                  communication and markets means the ability to "opt
                  out" of conventional morality
           + Loss of trust
             + even in families, especially if the government offers
                bounties and rewards
               - recall Pavel Morozov in USSR, DARE-type programs
                  (informing on parents)
               - more than 50% of all IRS suits involve one spouse
                  informing to the IRS
           + how will taxes be affected by the increased black market?
             - a kind of Laffer curve, in which some threshold of
                taxation triggers disgust and efforts to evade the taxes
             - not clear how large the current underground economy
                is....authorities are motivated to misstate the size
                (depending on their agenda)
           + Tax Evasion (I'm not defending taxation, just pointing out
              what most would call a dark side of CA)
             + By conducting business secretly, using barter systems,
                alternative currencies or credit systems, etc.
               - a la the lawyers who use AMIX-like systems to avoid
                  being taxed on mutual consultations
             + By doing it offshore
               - so that the "products" are all offshore, even though
                  many or most of the workers are telecommuting or using
                  CA schemes
               - recall that many musicians left Europe to avoid 90% tax
                  rates
             + the "nest egg" scam: drawing on a lump sum not reported
               + Scenario: Alice sells something very valuable-perhaps
                  the specs on a new product-to Bob. She deposits the
                  fee, which is, say, a million dollars, in a series of
                  accounts. This fee is not reported to the IRS or anyone
                  else.
                 - the fee could be in cash or in a "promise"
                 - in multiple accounts, or just one
                 + regardless, the idea is that she is now paid, say,
                    $70,000 a year for the next 20 years (what with
                    interest) as a "consultant" to the company which
                    represents her funds
                   - this of course does not CA of any form, merely some
                      discreet lawyers
                   - and of course Alice reports the income to the
                      IRS-they never challenge the taxpayer to "justify"
                      work done (and would be incapable of "disallowing"
                      the work, as Alice could call it a "retainer," or
                      as pay for Board of Directors duties, or
                      whatever...in practice, it's easiest to call it
                      consulting)
               + these scams are closely related to similar scams for
                  laundering money, e.g., by selling company assets at
                  artificially low (or high) prices
                 - an owner, Charles, could sell assets to a foreign
                    company at low prices and then be rewarded in tax-
                    free, under the table, cash deposited in a foreign
                    account, and we're back to the situation above
           + Collusion already is common; crypto methods will make some
              such collusions easier
             - antique dealers at an auction
           + espionage and trading of national secrets (this has
              positive aspects as well)
             - "information markets" and anonymous digital cash
             - (This realization, in late 1987, was the inspiration for
                the ideas behind crypto anarchy.)
           - mistrust
           - widening gap between rich and poor, or those who can use
              the tools of the age and those who can't
  16.10.3. The Positive Side of Crypto Anarchy
           - (other positive reasons are implicitly scattered throughout
              this outline)
           + a pure kind of libertarianism
             - those who are afraid of CA can stay away (not strictly
                true, as the effects will ripple)
           - a way to bypass the erosion of morals, contracts, and
              committments (via the central role of reputations and the
              exclusion of distorting governments)
           - individual responsibility
           - protecting privacy when using hypertext and cyberspace
              services (many issues here)
           - "it's neat" (the imp of the perverse that likes to see
              radical ideas)
           + A return to 4th Amendment protections (or better)
             - Under the current system, if the government suspects a
                person of hiding assets, of conspiracy, of illegal acts,
                of tax evasion, etc., they can easily seize bank
                accounts, stock accounts, boats, cars, ec. In particular,
                the owner has little opportunity to protect these assets.
           - increased liquidity in markets
           + undermining of central states
             - loss of tax revenues
             - reduction of control
           - freedom, personal liberty
           - data havens, to bypass local restrictive laws
           + Anonymous markets for assassinations will have some good
              aspects
             - the liquidation of politicians and other thieves, the
                killing of those who have assisted in the communalization
                of private property
             - a terrible swift sword
  16.10.4. Will I be sad if anonymous methods allow untraceable markets
            for assassinations? It depends. In many cases, people deserve
            death--those who have escaped justice, those who have broken
            solemn commitments, etc. Gun grabbing politicians, for
            example should be killed out of hand. Anonymous rodent
            removal services will be a tool of liberty. The BATF agents
            who murdered Randy Weaver's wife and son should be shot. If
            the courts won't do it, a market for hits will do it.
           - (Imagine for a moment an "anonymous fund" to collect the
              money for such a hit. Interesting possibilities.)
           - "Crypto Star Chambers," or what might be called
              "digilantes," may be formed on-line, and untraceably, to
              mete out justice to those let off on technicalities. Not
              altogether a bad thing.
  16.10.5. on interference in business as justified by "society supports
            you" arguments (and "opting out)
           + It has been traditionally argued that society/government
              has a right to regulate businesses, impose rules of
              behavior, etc., for a couple of reasons:
             - "to promote the general welfare" (a nebulous reason)
             + because government builds the infrastructure that makes
                business possible
               - the roads, transportation systems, etc. (actually, most
                  are privately built...only the roads and canal are
                  publically built, and they certainly don't _have_ to
                  be)
               - the police forces, courts, enforcement of contracts,
                  disputes, etc.
               - protection from foreign countries, tariff negotiations,
                  etc., even to the *physical* protection against
                  invading countries
           + But with crypto anarchy, *all* of these reasons vanish!
             - society isn't "enabling" the business being transacted
                (after all, the parties don't even necessarily know what
                countries the other is in!)
             - no national or local courts are being used, so this set
                of reasons goes out the window
             - no threat of invasion...or if there is, it isn't
                something governments can address
           + So, in addition to the basic unenforceability of outlawing
              crypto anarchy--short of outlawing encryption--there is
              also no viable argument for having governments interfere on
              these traditional grounds.
             - (The reasons for them to interfere based on fears for
                their own future and fears about unsavory and abominable
                markets being developed (body parts, assassinations,
                trade secrets, tax evasion, etc.) are of course still
                "valid," viewed from their perspective, but the other
                reasons just aren't.)

16.11. Ethics and Morality of Crypto Anarchy
  16.11.1. "How do you square these ideas with democracy?"
           - I don't; democracy has run amok, fulfilling de
              Tocqueville's prediction that American democracy would last
              only until Americans discovered they could pick the pockets
              of their neighbors at the ballot box
           - little chance of changing public opinion, of educating them
           - crypto anarchy is a movement of individual opting out, not
              of mass change and political action
  16.11.2. "Is there a moral responsibility to ensure that the overall
            effects of crypto anarchy are more favorable than unfavorable
            before promoting it?"
           - I don't think so, any more than Thomas Jefferson should
              have analyzed the future implications of freedom before
              pushing it so strongly.
           - All decisions have implications. Some even cost lives. By
              not becoming a doctor working in Sub-Saharan Africa, have I
              "killed thousands"? Certainly I might have saved the lives
              of thousands of villagers. But I did not kill them just
              because I chose not to be a doctor. Likewise, by giving
              money to starving peasants in Bangladesh, lives could
              undeniably be "saved." But not giving the money does not
              murder them.
           - But such actions of omission are not the same, in my mind,
              as acts of comission. My freedom, via crypto anarchy, is
              not an act of force in and of itself.
           - Developing an idea is not the same as aggression.
           - Crypto anarchy is about personal withdrawal from the
              system, the "technologies of disconnection," in Kevin
              Kelly's words.
  16.11.3. "Should individuals have the power to decide what they will
            reveal to others, and to authorities?"
           - For many or even most of us, this has an easy answer, and
              is axiomatically true. But others have doubts, and more
              people may have doubts as some easily anticipated
              develpoments occur.
           - (For example, pedophiles using the much-feared "fortress
              crypto," terrorists communicating in unbreakable codes, tza
              evaders, etc. Lots of examples.)
           - But because some people use crypto to do putatively evil
              things, should basic rights be given up? Closed doors can
              hide criminal acts, but we don't ban closed doors.
  16.11.4. "Aren't there some dangers and risks to letting people pick
            and choose their moralities?"
           - (Related to questions about group consensus, actions of the
              state vs. actions of the individual, and the "herd.)
           - Indeed, there are dangers and risks. In the privacy of his
              home, my neighbor might be operating a torture dungeon for
              young children he captures. But absent real evidence of
              this, most nations have not sanctioned the random searches
              of private dwellings (not even in the U.S.S.R., so far as I
              know).
  16.11.5. "As a member of a hated minority (crypto anarchists) I'd
            rather take my chances on an open market than risk official
            discrimination by the state.....Mercifully, the technology we
            are developing will allow everyone who cares to to decline to
            participate in this coercive allocation of power." [Duncan
            Frissell, 1994-09-08]
  16.11.6. "Are there technologies which should be "stopped" even before
            they are deployed?"
           - Pandora's Box, "things Man was not meant to know," etc.
           - It used to be that my answer was mostly a clear "No," with
              nuclear and biological weapons as the only clear exception.
              But recent events involving key escrow have caused me to
              rethink things.
           - Imagine a company that's developing home surveillance
              cameras...perhaps for burglar prevention, child safety,
              etc. Parents can monitor Junior on ceiling-mounted cameras
              that can't easily be tampered with or disconnected, without
              sending out alarms. All well and good.
           - Now imagine that hooks are put into these camera systems to
              send the captured images to a central office. Again, not
              necessarily a bad idea--vacationers may want their security
              company to monitor their houses, etc.
           - The danger is that a repressive government could make the
              process mandatory....how else to catch sexual deviates,
              child molestors, marijuana growers, counterfeiters, and the
              like?
           - Sound implausible, unacceptable, right? Well, key escrow is
              a form of this.
           - The Danger. That OS vendors will put these SKE systems in
              place without adequate protections against key escrow being
              made mandatory at some future date.
  16.11.7. "Won't crypto anarchy allow some people to do bad things?"
           - Sure, so what else is new? Private rooms allows plotters to
              plot their plots. Etc.
           - Not to sound too glib, but most of the things we think of
              as basic rights allow various illegal, distasteful, or
              crummy things to go on. Part of the bargain we make.
           - "Of course you could prevent contract killings by requiring
              everyone to carry government "escrowed" tape recordings to
              record all their conversations and requiring them to keep a
              diary at all times alibing their all their activities.
              This would also make it much easier to stamp out child
              pornography, plutonium smuggling, and social discrimination
              against the politically correct." [James Donald, 1994-09-
              09]

16.12. Practical Problems with Crypto Anarchy
  16.12.1. "What if "bad guys" use unbreakable crypto?"
           - What if potential criminals are allowed to have locks on
              their doors? What if potential rapists can buy pornography?
              What if....
           - These are all straw men used in varous forms throughout
              history by tyrants to control their populations. The
              "sheepocracies" of the modern so-called democratic era are
              voting away their former freedoms in favor of cradle to
              grave safety and security.
           - The latest tack is to propose limits on privacy to help
              catch criminals, pedophile, terrorists, and father rapers.
              God help us if this comes to pass. But Cypherpunks don't
              wait for God, they write code!
  16.12.2. Dealing with the "Abhorrent Markets"
           - such as markets for assassinations and extortion
           + Possibilities:
             + physical protection, physical capure
               - make it risky
               - (on the other hand, sniping is easy)
             + "flooding" of offers
               - "take a number" (meaning: get in line)
             - attacking reputations
           - I agree that more thought is needed, more thorough analysis
           - Some people have even pointed out the benefits of killing
              off tens of thousands of the corrupt politicians, narcs,
              and cops which have implemented fascist, collectivist
              policies for so long. Assassination markets may make this
              much more practical.
  16.12.3. "How is *fraud* dealt with in crypto anarchy?"
           - When the perpetrators can't even be identified.
           - One of the most interesting problems.
           - First, reputations matter. Repeat business is not assured.
              It is always best to not have too much at stake in any
              single transaction.
  16.12.4. "How do we know that crypto anarchy will work? How do we know
            that it won't plunge the world into barbarism, nuclear war,
            and terror?"
           - We don't know, of course. We never can.
           - However, things are already pretty bad. Look at Bosnia,
              Ruanda, and a hundred other hellholes and flashpoints
              around the world. Look at the nuclear arsenals of the
              superpowers, and look at who starts the wars. In nearly all
              cases, statism is to blame. States have killed a hundred
              million or more people in this century alone--think of
              Hitler, Stalin, Mao, and Pol Pot--through forced starvation
              of entire provinces, liquidation of the peasantry, killing
              of intellectuals, and mass exterminations of religious and
              ethnic groups. It's hard to imagine crypto anarchy causing
              anything that bad!
           - Crypto anarchy is a cyberspatially-mediated personal course
              of action; by itself it involves no actions such as
              terrorism or nuclear blackmail. One could just as easily
              ask, "Will freedom lead to nuclear blackmail, weapons
              trading, and pedophilia?" The answer is the same: maybe,
              but so what?
  16.12.5. It is true that crypto anarchy is not for everyone. Some will
            be too incompetent to prepare to protect themselves, and will
            want a protector. Others will have poor business sense.
  16.12.6. "But what will happen to the poor people and those on welfare
            if crypto anarchy really succeeds?"
           - "So?"
           - Many of us would see this as a good thing. Not just for
              Calvinist-Randite reasons, but also because it would break
              the cycle of dependency which has actually made things
              worse for the underclass in America (at least). See Charles
              Murray's "Losing Ground" for more on this.
           - And remember that a collapse of the tax system will mean
              more money left in the hands of former taxpayers, and hence
              more left over for true charity (for those who truly cannot
              help themselves).

16.13. Black Markets
  16.13.1. "Why would anyone use black markets?"
           + when the advantages of doing so outweigh the disadvantages
             - including the chance of getting caught and the
                consequences
             - (As the chances decline, this suggests a rise in
                punishment severity)
           - businesses will tend to shy away from illegal markets,
              unless...
           + Anonymous markets for medical products
             - to reduce liability, local ethical and religious laws
             - Example: Live AIDS vaccine...considered too risky for any
                company to introduce, due to inability to get binding
                waivers of liability (even for "fully informed" patients
                who face likely death)
             - markets in body parts...
  16.13.2. Crypto anarchy opens up some exciting possibilities for
            collusion in financial deals, for insider trading, etc.
           - I'm not claiming that this will mean instant riches, as
              markets are fairly efficient (*) and "insiders" often don't
              do well in the market. (* Some argue that relaxing laws
              against insider trading will make for an even fairer
              market...I agree with this.)
           - What I am claiming is the SEC and FinCEN computers will be
              working overtime to try to keep up with the new
              possibilities crypto anarchy opens up. Untraceable cash, as
              in offshore bank accounts that one can send anonymous
              trading instructions to (or for), means insider trading
              simply can't be stopped...all that happens is that insiders
              see their bank accounts increase (to the extent they win
              because of the insider trading...like I said, a debatable
              point).
           - Price signalling, a la the airline case of a few years back
              (which, you won't be surprised to hear, I have no problems
              with), will be easier. Untraceable communications, virtual
              meetings, etc.
  16.13.3. Information Markets
           - a la "information brokering," but mediated
              cryptographically
           - recall the 1981 market in Exocet missile codes (France,
              Argentina--later of relevance when an Exocet sank a British
              ship)
  16.13.4. Black Markets, Informal Economies, Export Laws
           + Transborder data flow, legal issues
             + complex..laws, copyrights, "national sovereignty"
               - e.g., Phillipines demanded in-the-clear transmissions
                  during bank loan renegotiations..and several Latin
                  American countries forbid encrypted transmissions.
           + Export, Technology Export, Export Control
             - Export Control Act
             - Office of Munitions (as in "Munitions Act", circa 1918)
             + export of some crypto gear shifted from Dept. of State,
                Office of Munitions, to Dept. of Commerce
               - Commodity Control List, allows s/w that is freely
                  available to the public to be exported without
                  additional paperwork
               - Munitions used to be stickier about export (some would
                  say justifiably paranoid)
             - Commodity Jurisdiction request, to see whether product
                for export falls under State or Commerce regulations
             - Trading with the Enemy Act
           - Exocet codes--black market sales of emasculated chips
  16.13.5. Smuggling and Black Markets
           + Black Markets in the USSR and Other Former East Bloc
              Nations
             + a major issue, because the normal mechanisms for free
                markets-property laws, shops, stock markets, hard
                currencies, etc.-have not been in place
               - in Russia, have never really existed
             + Role of "Mafia"
               - various family-related groups (which is how trade
                  always starts, via contacts and connections and family
                  loyalty, until corporations and their own structures of
                  loyalty and trust can evolve)
               + how the Mafia in Russia works
                 - bribes to "lose" materials, even entire trainloads
                 - black market currency (dollars favored)
             + This could cause major discontent in Russia
               - as the privileged, many of them ex-Communist officials,
                  are best prepared to make the transition to capitalism
               + those  in factory jobs, on pensions, etc., will not
                  have the disposable income to take advantage of the new
                  opportunities
                 - America had the dual advantages of a frontier that
                    people wanted to move to (Turner, Protestant ethic,
                    etc.) and a high-growth era (industrialization)
                 - plus, there was no exposure to other countries at
                    vastly higher living standards
           + Smuggling in the EEC
             + the dream of tariff-free borders has given way to the
                reality of a complex web of laws dictating what is
                politically correct and what is not:
               - animal growth hormones
               - artificial sweeteners are limited after 1-93 to a small
                  list of approved foods: and the British are finding
                  that their cherished "prawn cocktail-flavored crisps"
                  are to be banned (for export to EEC or completely?)
                  because they're made with saccharin or aspartame
               - "European content" in television and movies may limit
                  American productions...as with Canada, isn't this a
                  major abridgement of basic freedoms?
             + this may lead to a new kind of smuggling in "politically
                incorrect" items
               - could be argued that this is already the case with bans
                  on drugs, animal skins, ivory, etc. (so tediously
                  argued by Brin)
             - recall Turgut Ozal's refreshing comments about loosening
                up on border restrictions
           + as more items are declared bootleg, smuggling will
              increase...politically incorrect contraband (fur, ivory,
              racist and sexist literature)
             + the point about sexist and racist literature being
                contraband is telling: such literature (books, magazines)
                may not be formally banned, for that would violate the
                First Amendment, but may still be imported anonymously
                (smuggled) and distributed as if they were banned (!) for
                the reason of avoiding the "damage claims" of people who
                claim they were victimized, assaulted, etc. as a result
                of the literature!
               + avoidance of prosecution or damage claims for writing,
                  editing, distributing, or selling "damaging" materials
                  is yet another reason for anonymous systems to emerge:
                  those involved in the process will seek to immunize
                  themselves from the various tort claims that are
                  clogging the courts
                 - producers, distributors, directors, writers, and even
                    actors of x-rated or otherwise "unacceptable"
                    material may have to have the protection of anonymous
                    systems
                 - imagine fiber optics and the proliferation of videos
                    and talk shows....bluenoses and prosecutors will use
                    "forum shopping" to block access, to prosecute the
                    producers, etc.
             + Third World countries may declare "national sovereignty
                over genetic resources" and thus block the free export
                and use of plant- and animal-derived drugs and other
                products
               - even when only a single plant is taken
               - royalties, taxes, fees, licenses to be paid to local
                  gene banks
               - these gene banks would be the only ones allowed to do
                  genetic cataloguing
               - the problem is of course one of enforcement
           + technology, programs
             - scenario: many useful programs are priced for
                corporations (as with hotel rooms, airline tickets,
                etc.), and price-sensitive consumers will not pay $800
                for a program they'll use occasionally to grind out term
                papers and church newsletters
           + Scenario: Anonymous organ donor banks
             + e.g., a way to "market" rare blood types, or whatever,
                without exposing one's self to forced donation or other
                sanctions
               - "forced donation" involves the lawsuits filed by the
                  potential recipient
               - at the time of offer, at least...what happens when the
                  deal is consummated is another domain
             - and a way to avoid the growing number of government
                stings
           + the abortion and women's rights underground...a hopeful
              ally (amidst the generally antiliberty women's movement)
             - RU-486, underground abortion clinics (because many
                clinics have been firebombed, boycotted out of existence,
                cut off from services and supplies)
           + Illegal aliens and immigration
             - "The Boxer Barrier" used to seal barriers...Barbara Boxer
                wants the military and national guard to control illegal
                immigration, so it would be poetic justice indeed if this
                program has her name on it
  16.13.6. Organized Crime and Cryptoanarchy
           + How and Why
             + wherever money is to be made, some in the underworld will
                naturally take an interest
               - loan sharking, numbers games, etc.
             + they may get involved in the setup of underground banks,
                using CA protocols
               - shell games, anonymity
             - such Mafia involvement in an underground monetary system
                could really spread the techniques
             + but then both sides may be lobbying with the Mafia
               - the CA advocates make a deal with the devil
               - and the government wants the Mob to help eradicate the
                  methods
           + Specific Programs
             + False Identities
               - in the computerized world of the 90s, even the Mob (who
                  usually avoid credit cards, social security numbers,
                  etc.) will have to deal with how easily their movements
                  can be traced
               + so the Mob will involve itself in false IDs
                 - as mentioned by Koontz
             - Money Laundering, naturally
           + but some in the government see some major freelance
              opportunities in CA and begin to use it (this undermines
              the control of CA and actually spreads it, because the
              government is working at cross purposes)
             - analogous to the way the government's use of drug trade
                systems spread the techniques
  16.13.7. "Digital Escrow" accounts for mutually suspicious parties,
            especially in illegal transactions
           - drug deals, information brokering, inside information, etc.
           + But why will the escrow entity be trusted?
             + reputations
               - their business is being a reliable escrow holder, not
                  it destroying their reputation for a bribe or a threat
             + anonymity means the escrow company won't know who it's
                "burning," should it try to do so
               - they never know when they themselves are being tested
                  by some service
             - and potential bribers will not know who to contact,
                although mail could be addressed to the escrow company
                easily enough
  16.13.8. Private companies are often allies of the government with
            regards to black markets (or grey markets)
           - they see uncontrolled trade as undercutting their monopoly
              powers
           - a way to limit competition

16.14. Money Laundering and Tax Avoidance
  16.14.1. Hopelessness of controlling money laundering
           + I see all this rise in moneylaundering as an incredibly
              hopeful trend, one that will mesh nicely with the use of
              cryptography
             - why should export of currency be limited?
             - what's wrong with tax evasion, anyway?
           - corrupting, affects all transactions
           - vast amounts of money flowing
           - 2000 banks in Russia, mostly money-laundering
           + people and countries are so starved for hard currency that
              most banks outside the U.S. will happily take this money
             - no natural resources in many of these countries
             - hopeless to control
           - being presented as "profits vs. principals," but I think
              this is grossly misguided
           + Jeffery Robinson, "The Landrymen," interviewed on CNN, 6-24-
              94
             - "closer to anarchy" (yeah!)
             - hopeless to control
             - dozens of new countries, starved for hard currency, have
                autonomy to set banking policies (and most European
                countries turn a blind eye toward most of the anti-
                laundering provisions)
  16.14.2. Taxes and Crypto
           - besides avoidance, there are also issues of tax records,
              sales tax, receipts, etc.
           + this is another reason government may demand access to
              cyberspace:
             - to ensure compliance, a la a tamper-resistant cash
                register
             - to avoid under-the-table transactions
             - bribery, side payments, etc.
           - Note: It is unlikely that such access to records would stop
              all fraud or tax evasion. I'm just citing reasons for them
              to try to have access.
           - I have never claimed the tax system will collapse totally,
              or overnight, or without a fight. Things take time.
           + tax compliance rates dropping
             + the fabric has already unraveled in many countries, where
                the official standard of living is below the _apparent_
                standard of living (e.g., Italy).
               - tax evasion a major thing
               - money runs across the border into Switzerland and
                  Austria
             - Frissell's figures
             - media reports
           + Tax issues, and how strong crypto makes it harder and
              harder to enforce
             - hiding income, international markets, consultants,
                complexly structured transactions
  16.14.3. Capital Flight
           - "The important issue for Cypherpunks is how we should
              respond to this seemingly inevitable increased mobility of
              capital.  Does it pose a threat to privacy?  If so, let's
              write code to thwart the threat.  Does it offer us any
              tools we can use to fight the efforts of nation-states to
              take away our privacy?  If so, let's write code to take
              advantage of those tools." [ Sandy Sandfort, Decline and
              Fall, 1994--06-19]
  16.14.4. Money Laundering and Underground Banks
           + a vast amount of money is becoming available under the
              table: from skimming, from tax avoidance, and from illegal
              activities of all kinds
             - can be viewed as part of the internationalization of all
                enterprises: for example, the Pakistani worker who might
                have put his few rupees into some local bank now deposits
                it with the BCCI in Karachi, gaining a higher yield and
                also increasing the "multiplier" (as these rupees get
                lent out many times)
             - is what happened in the U.S. many years ago
             - this will accelerate as governments try to get more taxes
                from their most sophisticated and technical taxpayers,
                i.e., clever ways to hide income will be sought
           + BCCI, Money-Laundering, Front Banks, CIA, Organized Crime
             + Money Laundering
               - New York City is the main clearinghouse, Federal
                  Reserve of New York oversees this
               - Fedwire system
               - trillions of dollars pass through this system, daily
               + How money laundering can work (a maze of techniques)
                 - a million dollars to be laundered
                 - agent wires it, perhaps along with other funds, to
                    Panama or to some other country
                 - bank in Panama can issue it to anyone who presents
                    the proper letter
                 - various ways for it to move to Europe, be issued as
                    bearer stock, etc.
                 - 1968, offshore mutual funds, Bernie Kornfield
             + CIA often prefers banks with Mob connections
               - because Mob banks already have the necessary security
                  and anonymity
               - and are willing to work with the Company in ways that
                  conventional banks may not be
               + links go back to OSS and Mafia in Italy and Sicily, and
                  to heroin trade in SE Asia
                 - Naval Intelligence struck a deal in WW2 with Mafia,
                    wherby Meyer Lansky would protect the docks against
                    strikes (presumably in exchange for a "cut"), if
                    Lucky Luciano would be released at the end of the war
                    (he was)
                 - Operation Underworld: Mafia assisted Allied troops in
                    Sicily
                 - "the Corse"
                 + Luciano helped in 1947 to reopen Marseilles when
                    Communist strikers had shut it down
                   - continuing the pattern of cooperation begun during
                      the war
                   - thus establishing the French Connection!
                 - Nugan Hand Bank
               + BCCI and Bank of America favored by CIA
                 - Russbacher says B of A a favored cover
                 + we will almost certainly discover that BCCI was the
                    main bank used, with the ties to Bank of America
                    offices in Vienna
                   + Bank of America has admitted to having had early
                      ties with BCCI in the early 1970s, but claims to
                      have severed those ties
                     - however, Russbacher says that CIA used B of A as
                        their preferred bank in Europe, especially since
                        it had ties to companies like IBM that were used
                        as covers for their covert ops
                 - Vienna was a favored money-laundering center for CIA,
                    especially using Bank of America
             + a swirl of paper fronts, hiding the flows from regulators
                and investors
               - "nominees" used to hide true owners and true activities
               - various nations have banking secrecy laws, creating the
                  "veil" that cannot be pierced
             + CIA knew about all of the flights to South America (and
                probably elsewhere, too)
               - admitted Thomas Polgar, a senior ex-CIA official, in
                  testimony  on 9-19-91
               - this indicates that CIA knew about the arms deals, the
                  drug deals, and the various other schemes and scams
             + Earlier CIA-Bank Scandals (Nugan Hand and Castle Bank)
               + Nugan Hand Bank, Australia
                 + Frank Nugan, Sydney, Australia, died in 1980
                   + apparent suicide, but clearly rigged
                     - Mercedes, rifle with no fingerprints, position
                        all wrong
                     - evidence that he'd had a change of heart-was
                        praying daily, a la Charles Colson-and was
                        thinking about getting out of the business
                 + set up Nugan Hand Bank in 1973
                   - private banking services, tax-free deposits in
                      Caymans
                   + used by CIA agents, both for Agency operations and
                      for their own private slush/retirement funds
                     - several CIA types on the payroll (listed their
                        addresses as same as Air America)
                     - William Colby on Board, and was their lawyer
                   + links to organized crime, e.g., Santo Trafficante,
                      Jr.
                     - Florida, heroin, links to JFK assassination
                     - trafficante was known as "the Cobra" and handled
                        many transactions for the CIA
                 + money-laundering for Asian drug dealers
                   + Golden Triangle: N-H even had branches in GT
                     - and branch in  Chiang Mai, in Thailand
                 - links to arms dealers, like Edwin P. Wilson
                 + U.S. authorites refused to cooperate with
                    investigations
                   - and when info was released, it was blacked out with
                      a "B-1" note, implying national security
                      implications
                   + investigations by Australian Federal Bureau of
                      Narcotics were thwarted-agents transferred and
                      Bureau disbanded shortly thereafter
                     - similar to "Don't fuck with us" message sent to
                        FBI and DEA by CIA
                 + N-H Bank had close working relation with Australian
                    Security Intelligence Organization (ASIO)
                   - NSA tapped phone conversations (speculative) of
                      Nugan that indicated ASIO collusion with N-H Bank
                      in the drug trade
                 + Pine Gap facility, near Alice Springs (NSA, NRO)
                   - P.M. Gough Whitlam's criticism of Pine Gap led to
                      CIA-ASIO plot to destroy the Whitlam gov't.
                   - November 1975 fall instigated with wiretaps and
                      forgeries
                 + Nugan Hand Bank was also involved with "Task Force
                    157," a Naval Intelligence covert operation, given
                    the cover name "Pierce Morgan" (a good name?)
                   - reported to Henry Kissinger
                   - recall minor point that Navy is often the preferred
                      service for the ruling elite (the real preppies)
                 + and George Bush's son, George W. Bush, was involved
                    with Nugan Hand:
                   - linked to William Quasha, who handled N-H deals in
                      Phillipines
                   + owners of Harken Energy Corp. a Texas-based company
                      that bought G.W. Bush's oil company "Spectrum 7" in

                     - later got offshore drilling rights to Bahrain's
                        oil-with G.W. Bush on the Board of Directors
                     - could this be another link to Gulf Crisis?

                 + Robert Vesco, Bebe Rebozo, and Howard Hughes
                   - in contrast to the "Eastern Establishment," these
                      were Nixon's insiders
                   - links with ex-CIA agent Robert Maheu (who worked
                      for Hughes); onvolved withTrafficante, CIA plot to

                 - late 60s
                 - investigation of "brass plate" companies in Caymans,
                    Bahamas
                 + Plot Scenario: Operation Tradewinds uncovered many
                    UltraBlack operations, forcing them to retrench and
                    dig in deeper, sacrificing several hundred million
                   - circa 1977 (Castle Bank shut down)
               + World Finance Corporation (WFC)
                 + started in 1971 in Coral Gables
                   - first known as Republic National Corporation
                   - Walter Surrey, ex-OSS, like Helliwell of Castle
                      Bank, helped incorporate it
                 + Business
                   - exploited cash flows in Florida
                   - dealt with CIA, Vesco, Santo Trafficante, Jr.
                   - also got loan deposits from Arabs

                      pay agents
                   + a related company was Dominion Mortgage Company,
                      located at same address as WFC
                     - linked to narcotics flow into Las Vegas

                 - investigated by R. Jerome Sanford, Miami assistant
                    U.S. attorney
                 - Dade County Organized Crime Bureau also involved in
                    the 1978 investigation
               - Rewald and his banking deals
               - BCCI was a successor to this bank
             + CIA and DEA Links to Drug Trade
               - former agents and drug traffickers were frequently
                  recruited by DEA and CIA to run their own drug
                  operation, sometimes with political motivations
               - Carlos Hern‡ndez recruited by BNDD (Bureau of Narcotics
                  and Dangerous drugs, predecessor to DEA) to form a
                  death squad to assassinate other drug traffickers
               + possible links of the drug dealers to
                  UltraBlack/Witness Security Program
                 - agents in Florida, the stock broker killing in 1987
                 - Seal was betrayed by the DEA and CIA, allowed to be
                    killed by the Columbians
             + Afghan Rebels, Arms to Iran (and Iraq), CIA, Pakistan
               - there was a banking and arms-running network centered
                  in Karachi, home of BCCI, for the various arms deals
                  involving  Afghan rebels
               - Karachi, Islamabad, other cities
             + Influence Peddling, Agents
               - a la the many senior lawyers hired by BCCI (Clark
                  Clifford, Frank Manckiewicz [spelling?]
               + illustrates again the basic corruptability of a
                  centralized command economy, where regulators and
                  lawmakers are often in the pockets of corrupt
                  enterprises
                 - clearly some scandals and losses will occur in free
                    markets, but at least the free markets will not be
                    backed up with government coercion
             + Why CIA is Involved in So Many Shady Deals?
               + ideal cover for covert operations
                 - outside audit channels
                 - links to underworld
               + agents providing for their own retirements, their own
                  private deals, and feathering their own nests
                 - freedom from interferance
                 - greed
               + deals like that of Noriega, in which CIA-supported
                  dictators and agents provided for their own lavish
                  lifestyles\
                 - and the BCCI-Noriega links are believed to have
                    contributed to the CIA's unwillingness to question
                    the activities of the BCCI (actually, the Justice
                    Department)
             + Role of Banks in Iraq and Gulf War, Iraq-Gate, Scandals
               - Export Import Bank (Ex-Im), CCC
               - implicated in the arming of Iraq
               - Banco Lavorzo Nazionale [spelling?]
               + CIA was using BNL to arrange $5B in transfers, to arm
                  Iraq, to ensure equality with Iran
                 - because BNL wouldn't ask where it came from
                 - federally guaranteed loans used to finance covert ops
                 + the privatizing of covert ops by the CIA and NSA
                   - deniability
                   - they subcontracted the law-breaking
                   - the darker side of capitalism did the real work
                   - but the crooks learned quickly just how much they
                      could steal...probably 75% of stolen money
                   - insurance fraud...planes allowed to be stolen, then
                      shipped to Contras, with Ollie North arguing that
                      nobody was really hurt by this whole process
               + ironically, wealthy Kuwaitis were active in financing
                  "instant banks" for money laundering and arms
                  transactions, e.g., several in Channel Islands
                 - Ahmad Al Babtain Group of Companies, Ltd., a
                    Netherlands Antilles corporation
               - Inslaw case fits in with this picture
             + Federal Reserve and SEC Lack the Power to "Peirce the
                Veil" on Foreign Banks
               - as the Morgenthau case in Manhattan develops
               - a well-known issue
             + But should we be so surprised?
               - haven't banks always funded wars and arms merchants?
               - and haven't some of them failed?
               - look at the Rothschilds
               - what is surprising is that so many people knew what it
                  was doing, what its business was, and that it was even
                  nicknamed "Banks of Crooks and Criminals International"
             + Using software agents for money laundering and other
                illegal acts
               + these agents act as semi-autonomous programs that are a
                  few steps beyond simple algortihms
                 - it is not at all clear that these agents could do
                    very much to run portfolio, because nothing really
                    works
               - real use could be as "digital cutouts": transferring
                  wealth to other agents (also controlled from afar, like
                  marionettes)
               - advantage is that they can be programmed to perform
                  operations that are perhaps illegal, but without
                  traceability
             + Information brokers as money launderers (the two are
                closely related)
               - the rise of AMIX-style information markets and Sterling-
                  style "data havens" will provide new avenues for money
                  laundering and asset-hiding
               + information is intrinsically hard to value, hard to put
                  a price tag on (it varies according to the needs of the
                  buyers)
                 - meaning that transnational flows of inforamation
                    cannot be accurately valued (assigned a cash value)
                 - is closely related to the idea of  informal
                    consulting and the nontaxable nature of it
           - cardboard boxes filled with cash, taped and strapped, but
              still bursting open
           - gym bags carrying relatively tiny amounts of the skim: a
              mere hundred thousand in $100s
           + L.A. becoming a focus for much of this cash
             - nearness to Mexico, large immigrant communities
             - freeways and easy access
             + hundreds of airstrips, dozens of harbors
               - though East Coast seems to have even more, so this
                  doesn't seem like a compelling reason
               - Ventura County and Santa Barbara
  16.14.5. Private Currencies, Denationalization of Money
           - Lysander Spooner advocated these private currencies
           - and "denationalization of money" is a hot topic
           + is effect, alternatives to normal currency already exist
             - coupons, frequent flier coupons, etc.
             + telephone cards and coupons (widely used in Asia and
                parts of Europe)
               - ironically, U.S. had mostly opted for credit cards,
                  which are fully traceable and offer minimal privacy,
                  while other nations have embraced the anonymity of
                  their kind of cards...and this seems to be carrying
                  over to the toll booth systems being planned
             - barter networks
             - chop marks (in Asia)
             + "reputations" and favors
               - if Al gives Bob some advice, is this taxable? (do
                  lawyers who talk amongst themselves report the
                  transactions/ od course not, and yet this is
                  effectively either a barter transaction or an outright
                  gift)
             + sophisticated financial alternatives to the dollar
               - various instruments
               - futures, forward contracts, etc.
             - "information" (more than just favors)
             + art works and similar physical items
               - not a liquid market, but for high rollers, an easy way
                  to transfer hundreds of millions of dollars (even with
                  the discounted values of a stolen item, and not all the
                  items will be stolen...many people will be very careful
                  to never travel with stolen art)
               - diamonds, gems have long been a form of transportable
                  wealth
               + art works need not be declared at most (?) borders
                 - this may change with time
  16.14.6. Tax Evasion Schemes
           - unreported income, e.g., banks like the BCCI obviously did
              not report what they or their customers were doing to the
              various tax authorities (or anyone else)
           - deferred income, via the kind of trust funds discussed here
              (wherein payment is deferred and some kind of trust is used
              to pay smaller amounts per year)
           + Asset-Hiding, Illegal Payments, Bribes, and Tax Evasion
              Funds Can Be Protected in a "Retirement Fund"
             + e.g., a politician or information thief-perhaps an Intel
                employee who sells something for $1M-can buy shares in a
                crypto-fund that then ensures he is hired by a succession
                of consulting firms for yearly consulting...or even just
                placed on a "retainer" of, say, $100K a year
               + IRS may come to have doubts about such services, but
                  unless the government steps in and demands detailed
                  inspection of actual work done-and even then I think
                  this would be impossible and/or illegal-such
                  arrangements would seem to be foolproof
                 + why can't government demand proof of work done?
                   - who judges the value of an employee?
                   - of advice given, of reports generated, or of the
                      value of having a consultant "on retainer"?
                   - such interference would devastate many vested
                      interests
               + tax and other advantages of these "crypto annuities"
                 - tax only paid on the yearly income, not on the lump
                    sum
                 - authorities are not alerted to the sudden receipt of
                    a lump sum (an ex-intelligence official who receives
                    a payement of $1 M will come under suspicion, exactly
                    as would a politician)
                 - and a lump sum payment might well arouse suspicions
                    and be considered evidence of some criminal activity
                 + the original lump sum is protected from confiscation
                    by governments, by consideration in alimony or
                    bankruptcy cases, etc.
                   - such "consulting annuities" may be purchased just
                      so as to insulate earnings from alimony,
                      bankruptcy, etc.
                   - as usual, I'm not defending these steps as moral or
                      as good for the business climate of the world, just
                      as inevitable consequences of many current trends
                      and technical developments
             + the "shell game" is used to protect the funds
               - with periodic withdrawals or transfers
             - note that this whole scheme can pretty much be done by
                attorneys and agents today, though they may be subpoenaed
                or otherwise encouraged to blab
             + it may not even be illegal for a consultant to take his
                fee over a period of many years
               + the IRS may claim the "discounted present value" as a
                  lump sum, but other folks already do things like this
                 - royalty streams (and nobody claims an author must
                    agree with the IRS to some estimated value of this
                    stream)
                 - percentages of the gross (and the like)
                 - engineers and other professionals are often kept on
                    payrolls not so much for their instantaneous
                    achievements as for their past and projected
                    achievements-are we to treat future accomplishments
                    in a lump sum way?
               + IRS and others may try to inspect the terms of the
                  employment or consulting agreement, but these seems too
                  invasive and cumbersome
                 + it makes the government a third party in all
                    negotiations, requiring agents to be present in all
                    talks or at least to read and understand all
                    paperwork
                   - and even then, there could be claims that the
                      government didn't follow the deals
                 - not enough time or manpower to handle all these
                    things
                 - and the invasion of privacy is extreme!
                 + Scenario: the Fincen-type agencies may deal with the
                    growing threat of CA-type systems (and encryption in
                    general) by involving the government in ostensibly
                    private deals
                   - analogous to the sales tax and bookkeeping
                      arrangements (where gov't. is a third party to all
                      transactions)
                   + or EEOC, race and sex discimination cases
                     - will transcripts and recordings of all job
                        interviews come to be required?
                     - "laying track"
                   - OSHA, pollution, etc.
                   + software copying laws (more to the point):
                      government seems to have the power to enter a
                      business to see if illegal copies are in use; this
                      may first require a warrant
                     + how long before various kinds of software are
                        banned?
                       - with the argument being that some kinds of
                          software are analogous to lockpicks and other
                          banned burglar tools
                       - "used to facillitate the illegal copying of
                          protected software"
                     + the threat of encryption for national security as
                        well as for the money-laundering and illegal
                        payments possibilities may cause the government
                        to place restrictions on the use of crypto
                        software for anything except approved uses
                        (external e-mail, etc.)
                       - and even these uses can of course be subverted
             - and crypto techniques are not actually necessary: lawyers
                and other discreet agents will suffice
             + furthermore, corporations have a fair amount of lattitude
                in setting retirement policies and benefits, and so the
                methods I've described to shelter current income may
                become more widespread
               + though there may be some proviso that if benefits
                  exceeed some percentage of yearly income, factoring in
                  years on the job, that these benefits are taxed in some
                  punative way
                 - e.g.., a corporation that pays $100K a year to a
                    critical technical person for a year of work and then
                    pays him $60K a year for the next ten years could
                    reasonably be believed to have set up a system to
                    help him avoid taxes on a large lump sum payment
             + Asset-hiding, to avoid seizure in bankruptcies, lawsuits
               + e.g., funds placed in accounts which are secret, or in
                  systems/schemes over which the asset-hider has control
                  of some kind (voting, consulting, etc.)
                 - this is obscure: what I'm thinking of is some kind of
                    deal in which Albert is hired by Bob as an "advisor"
                    on financial matters: but Bob's money comes from
                    Albert and so the quid pro quo is that Bob will take
                    Albert's advice....hence the effective laundering and
                    protection
             + May also be used to create "multi-tier" currency systems,
                e.g., where reported transactions are some fraction of
                actuals
               - suppose we agree to deal at some artificially low
                  value: electricians and plumbers may barter with each
                  other at a reported $5 an hour, while using underground
                  accounts to actually trade at more realistic levels
               + government (IRS) has laws about "fair value"-but how
                  could these laws be enforced for such intangibles as
                  software?
                 - if I sell a software program for $5000, can the
                    government declare this to be over or underpriced?
                 - likewise, if a plumber charges $5 an hour, can the
                    government, suspecting tax evasion, force him to
                    charge more?
               - once again, the nature of taxation in our increasingly
                  many-dimensioned economy seems to necessitate major
                  invasions of privacy
  16.14.7. "Denationalization of Money"
           - as with the old SF standby of "credits"
           + cf. the books on denationalization of money, and the idea
              of competing currencies
             - digital cash can be denominated in these various
                currencies, so it makes the idea of competing currencies
                more practical
             - to some extent, it already exists
           + the hard money advocates (gold bugs) are losing their
              faith, as they see money moving around and never really
              landing in any "hard" form
             - of course, it is essential that governments and groups
                not have the ability to print more money
           - international networks will probably denominate
              transactions in whatever currencies are the most stable and
              least inflationary (or least unpredictably inflationary)

16.15. Intellectual Property
  16.15.1. Concepts of property will have to change
           - intellectual property; enforcement is becoming problematic
           - when thieves cannot be caught
  16.15.2. Intellectual property debate
           - include my comment about airwaves
           + work on payment for items...Brad Cox, Peter Sprague, etc.
             - Superdistribution, metered usage
           - propertarian
           - many issues

16.16. Markets for Contract Killings, Extortion, etc.
  16.16.1. Note: This is a sufficiently important topic that it deserves
            its own heading. There's material on this scattered around
            this document, material I'll collect together when I get a
            chance.
  16.16.2. This topic came up several times on then Extropians mailing
            list, where David Friedman (author of "The Machinery of
            Freedom" and son of Nobel Prize winner Milton Friedman) and
            Robin Hanson debated this with me.
  16.16.3. Doug Cutrell summarized the concerns of many when he wrote:
           - "...the availability of truly secure anonymity, strong
              encryption, and untraceable digital cash could allow
              contract killing to be an openly conducted business.  For
              example, an anonymous news post announces a public key
              which is to be used to encode a contract kill order, along
              with a digital cash payment.  The person placing the
              contract need only anonymously place the encrypted message
              in alt.test.  Perhaps it is even possible to make it
              impossible to tell that the message was encrypted with the
              contract killer's public key (the killer would have to
              attempt decryption of all similarly encoded messages on
              alt.test, but that might be quite feasible).  Thus it could
              be completely risk free for anyone to place a contract on
              anyone else." [Doug Cutrell, 1994-09-09]
  16.16.4. Abhorrent markets
           - contract killings
           - can collect money anonymously to have someone
              whacked...nearly anyone who is controversial can generate
              enough "contributions"
           - kidnapping, extortion
  16.16.5. Dealing with Such Things:
           + never link physical ID with pseudonyms! (they won't kill
              you if they don't know who you are)
             - and even if one pseudonym is linked, make sure your
                financial records are not linkable
           - trust no one
           - increased physical security...make the effort of killing
              much more potentially dangerous
           - flooding attacks..tell extortionists to "get in line"
              behind all the other extortionists
           + announce to world that one does not pay extortionists...set
              up protocol to ensure this
             - yes, some will die as a result of this
           - console yourself with the fact that though some may die,
              fewer are dying as a result of state-sponsored wars and
              terrorism (historically a bigger killer than contract
              killings!)

16.17. Persistent Institutions
  16.17.1. Strong crypto makes possible the creation of institutions
            which can persist for very long periods of time, perhaps for
            centuries.
           - such institutions already exist: churches (Catholics of
              several orders), universities, etc.
  16.17.2. all of these "persistent" services (digital banks, escrow
            services, reputation servers, etc.) require much better
            protections against service outages, seizures by governments,
            natural disasters, and even financial collapse than do most
            existing computer services-an opportunity for offshore escrow-
            like services
           - to maintain a distributed database, with unconditional
              privacy, etc.
           + again, it is imperative that escrow companies require all
              material placed in it to be encrypted
             - to protect them against lawsuits and claims by
                authorities (that they stole information, that they
                censored material, that they are an espionage conduit,
                etc.)
  16.17.3. Escrow Services
           + "Digital Escrow" accounts for mutually suspicious parties,
              especially in illegal transactions
             - drug deals, information brokering, inside information,
                etc.
             + But why will the escrow entity be trusted?
               + reputations
                 - their business is being a reliable escrow holder, not
                    it destroying their reputation for a bribe or a
                    threat
               + anonymity means the escrow company won't know who it's
                  "burning," should it try to do so
                 - they never know when they themselves are being tested
                    by some service
               - and potential bribers will not know who to contact,
                  although mail could be addressed to the escrow company
                  easily enough
           - like bonding agencies
           - key is that these entities stand to gain very little by
              stealing from their customers, and much to lose (hinges on
              ratio of any single transaction to size of total market)
           - useful for black markets and illegal transactions (a
              reliable third party that both sides can trust, albeit not
              completely)
  16.17.4. Reputation-Based Systems
           + Credit Rating Services that are Immune from Meddling and
              Lawsuits
             + with digital pseudonyms, true credit rating data bases
                can be developed
               - with none of the "5 year expirations" (I mean, who are
                  you to tell me I must not hold it against a person that
                  records show he's declares Chapter 7 every 5 years or
                  so?...such information is information, and cannot be
                  declared illegal, despite the policy issues that are
                  involved)
               + this could probably be done today, using offshore data
                  banks, but then there might develop injunctions against
                  use by Stateside companies
                 - how could this be enforced? stings? entrapment?
                 + it may be that credit-granting entities will be
                    forced to use rigid formulas for their decisions,
                    with a complete audit trail available to the
                    applicant
                   - if any "discretion" or judgment is allowed, then
                      these extralegal or offshore inputs can be used
                   - related to "redlining" and other informal
                      signalling mechanisms
                   - remember that Prop. 103 attempted to bypass normal
                      laws of economics
             + AMIX-like services will offer multiple approaches here
               + ranging from conventional credit data bases, albeit
                  with lower costs of entry (e.g., a private citizen
                  could launch a "bankruptcy filings" data base, using
                  public records, with no expiration-they're just
                  reporting the truth, e.g., that Joe Blow filed for
                  personal bankruptcy in 1987
                 - this gets into some of the strange ideas involving
                    mandatory rewriting of the truth, as when "credit
                    records are expunged" (expunged from what? from my
                    personal data bases? from records that were public
                    and that I am now selling access to?)
                 + there may be arguments that the "public records" are
                    copyrighted or otherwise owned by someone and hence
                    cannot be sold
                   - telephone book case (however, the Supremes held
                      that the "creative act" was the specific
                      arrangement)
                 - one ploy may be a Habitat-like system, where some of
                    the records are "historical"
               - to offshore data bases
           + Book Reviews, Music Reviews
             - sometimes with pseudonyms to protect the authors from
                retaliation or even lawsuits
           + "What should I buy?" services, a la Consumer Reports
             - again, protection from lawsuits
  16.17.5. Crypto Banks and the "Shell Game" as a Central Metaphor
           + Central metaphor: the Shell Game
             - description of conventional shell game (and some
                allusions to con artists on a street corner-the hand is
                quicker than the eye)
             + like entering a room filled with safe deposit boxes, with
                no surveillance and no way to monitor activity in the
                boxes....and user can buy new boxes anonymously,
                transferring contents amongst the boxes
               - only shutting down the entire system and forcing all
                  the boxes open would do anything-and this would "pool"
                  all of the contents (unless a law was passed saying
                  people could "declare" the contents before some
                  day....)
             + the shell game system can be "tested"-by testing
                services, by suspicious individuals, whatever-at very low
                cost by dividing some sum amongst many accounts and
                verifying that the money is still there (by retrieving or
                cashing them in)
               - and remember that the accounts are anonymous and are
                  indistinguishable, so that the money cannot be seized
                  without repercussions
             + this is of course the way banks and similar reputation-
                based institutions have always (or mostly) worked
               - people trusted the banks not to steal their money by
                  verifying over some period of time that their money was
                  not vanishing
               - and by relying upon some common sense ideas of what the
                  bank's basic business was (the notion that a bank
                  exists to continue in business and will make more money
                  over some long run period by being trustworthy than it
                  would make in a one-shot ripoff)
           + Numbered accounts
             - recall that Switzerland has bowed to international
                pressure and is now limiting (or eliminating) numbered
                accounts (though other countries are still allowing some
                form of such accounts, especially Lichtenstein and
                Luxembourg)
             + with crypto numbers, even more security
               - "you lose your number, tough"
             - but the money must exist in some form at some time?
             + options for the physical form of the money
               + accounts are shares in a fund that is publicly invested
                 - shares act as "votes" for the distribution of
                    proceeds
                 - dividends are paid to the account (and sent wherever)
                 - an abstract, unformed idea: multiple tiers of money,
                    like unequal voting rights of stock...
               + could even be physical deposits
                 - perhaps even manipulated by automatic handling
                    systems (though this is very insecure)
           - the Bennett-Ross proposal for Global Data Services is
              essentially the early form of this
  16.17.6. cryonicists will seek "crypto-trusts" to protect their assets
           + again, the "crypto" part is not really necessary, given
              trustworthy lawyers and similar systems
             - but the crypto part-digital money-further automates the
                system, allowing smaller and more secure transactions
                (overhead is lower, allowing more dispersions and
                diffusion)
             - and eliminates the human link
             - thus protecting better against subpoenas, threats, etc.
           + and to help fund "persistent institutions" that will fund
              research and protect them in suspension
             - they may also place their funds in "politically correct"
                longterm funds-which may or may not exert a postive
                ifluence in the direction they wish, what with the law of
                unintended consequences and all
                opl
           + many avenues for laundering money for persistent
              institutions
             + dummy corporations (or even real corporations)
               - with longterm consulting arrangements
               - "shell game" voting
           + as people begin to believe that they may just possibly be
              revived at some future time, they will begin to worry about
              protecting their current assets
             + recollections of "Why Call Them Back from Heaven?"
               - worries about financial stability, about confiscation
                  of wealth, etc.
             - no longer will ersatz forms of immortality-endowments fo
                museums, universities, etc.-be as acceptable...people
                will want the real thing
           + Investments that may outlive current institutions
             - purchases of art works (a la Bill Gates, who is in fact a
                possibel model for this kind of behavior)
             - rights to famous works, with provision for the copyright
                expirations, etc. (which is why physical possession is
                preferable)
             - shell games, of course (networks of reputation-based
                accounts)
           - Jim Bennett reports that Saul Kent is setting up such
              things in Lichtenstein for Alcor (which is what I suggested
              to Keith Henson several years ago)

16.18. Organized Crime: Triads, Yakuza, Mafia, etc.
  16.18.1. "The New Underworld Order"
           + Claire Sterling's "Thieve's World"
             - (Sterling is well-known for her conservative views on
                political matters, having written the  controversial "The
                Terror Connection," which basically dismissed the role of
                the CIA and other U.S. agencies in promoting terrorism.
                "Thieve's World" continues the alarmist stance, but has
                some juicy details anyway.)
             - she argues for more law enforcement
             + but it was the corrupt police states of Nazi Germany,
                Sovet Russia, etc., that gave so many opportunities for
                modern corruption
               - and the CIA-etc. drug trade, Cold War excuses, and
                  national security state waivers
               + in the FSU, the Russian Mafia is the chief beneficiary
                  of privatization...only they had the cash and the
                  connections to make the purchases (by threatening non-
                  Mob bidders, by killing them, etc.)
                 - as someone put in, the world's first complete
                    criminal state
  16.18.2. "Is the criminal world interested in crypto? Could they be
            early adopters of these advanced techniques?"
           - early use: BBS/Compuserve messages, digital flash paper,
              codes
           - money-laundering, anstalts, banks
           - Triads, chop marks
           - Even though this use seem inevitable, we should probably be
              careful here. Both because the clientele for our advice may
              be violent, and ditto for law enforcement. The conspiracy
              and RICO laws may be enough to get anyone who advises such
              folks into major trouble. (Of course, advice and consulting
              may happen throught the very same untraceable technology!)
  16.18.3. crypto provides some schemes for more secure drug
            distribution
           - cells, dead drops, secure transfers to foreign accounts
           - communication via pools, or remailers
           - too much cash is usually the problem...
           - "follow the money" (FinCEN)
           - no moral qualms...nearly all drugs are less dangerous than
              alcohol is...that drug was just too popular to outlaw
           - this drug scenario is consistent with the Triad/Mob
              scenario

16.19. Privately Produced Law, Polycentric Law, Anarcho-Capitalism
  16.19.1. "my house, my rules"
  16.19.2. a la David Friedman
  16.19.3. markets for laws, Law Merchant
           - corporations, other organizations have their own local
              legal rules
           - Extropians had much debate on this, and various competing
              legal codes (as an experiment...not very sucessful, for
              various reasons)
           - "Snow Crash"
  16.19.4. the Cypherpunks group is itself a good example:
           - a few local rules (local to the group)
           - a few constraints by the host machine environment (toad,
              soda)
           + but is the list run on "United States law"?
             - with members in dozens of countries?
           - only when the external laws are involved (if one of us
              threatened another, and even then this is iffy) could the
              external laws....
           - benign neglect, by necessity
  16.19.5. I have absolutely no faith in the law when it comes to
            cyberspatial matters (other matters, too).
           - especially vis-a-vis things like remote access to files, a
              la the AA BBS case
           - "the law is an ass"
           - patch one area, another breaks
           - What then? Technology. Remailers, encryption
  16.19.6. Contracts and Cryptography
           + "How can contracts be enforced in crypto anarchy
              situations?"
             - A key question, and one which causes many people to
                question whether crypto anarchy can work at all.
             + First, think of how many situations are _already_
                essentially outside the scope of the law...and yet in
                which something akin to "contracts" are enforceable,
                albeit not via the legal process.
               - friends, relationships
               + personal preferences in food, books, movies, etc.
                 - what "recourse" does one have in cases where a meal
                    is unsatisfactory? Not going back to the restaurant
                    is usually the best recourse (this is also a hint
                    about the importance of "future expectation of
                    business" as a means of dealing with such things).
             - In these cases, the law is not directly involved. In
                fact, the law is not involved in _most_ human (and
                nonhuman!) interactions.
             + The Main Approaches:
               + Reputations.
                 - reputations are important, are not lightly to be
                    regarded
               - Repeat Business.
               - Escrow Services.
           + The "right of contract" (and the duty to adhere to them, to
              not try to change the contract after the facts) is a
              crucial building block.
             - Imagine a society in which contracts are valid. This
                allows those willing to sign contracts setting limits on
                malpractice to get cheaper health care, while those who
                won't sign such contracts are free to sue--but will of
                course have to pay more for health care. Nothing is free,
                and frivolous malpractice lawsuits have increased
                operating costs. (Recall the "psychic" who alleged that
                her psychic powers were lost after a CAT scan. A jury
                awarded her millions of dollars. Cf. Peter Huber's books
                on liability laws.)
             - Now imagine a society in which it is never clear if a
                contract is valid, or whether courts will overturn or
                amend a contract. This distorts the above analysis, and
                so hospitals, for example, have to build in safety
                margins and cushions.
           + Crypto can help by creating escrow or bonding accounts held
              by third parties--untraceable to the other parties--which
              act as bonding agents for completion of contracts.
             - Such arrangements may not be allowed. For example, a
                hospital which attempted to deal with such a bonding
                agency, and which asked customers to also deal with them,
                could face sanctions.
           - "Secured credit cards" are a current example: a person pays
              a reserve amount greater than the card limits (maybe 110%).
              The reason for doing this is not to obtain "credit,"
              obviously, but to be able to order items over the phone, or
              to avoid carrying cash. (The benefit is thus in the
              _channel_ of commerce).
  16.19.7. Ostracism, Banishment in Privately Produced Law
           + Voluntary and discretionary electronic communities also
              admit the easy possibility of banishment or ostracism
              (group-selected kill files). Of course, enforcement is
              generally difficult, e.g., there is nothing to stop
              individuals from continuing to communicate with the
              ostracized individual using secure methods.
             - I can imagine schemes in which software key escrow is
                used, but these seem overly complicated and intrusive.
             - The ability of individuals, and even subgroups, to thwart
                the ostracism is not at all a bad thing.
             -
           - "In an on-line world it would be much easier to enforce
              banishment or selective ostracism than in real life.
              Filtering agents could look for certificates from accepted
              enforcement agencies before letting messages through. Each
              user could have a set of agencies which were compatible
              with his principles, and another set of "outlaws".  You
              could even end up with the effect of multiple "logical
              subnets" of people who communicate with each other but not
              outside their subnet.  Some nets might respect intellectual
              property, others not, and so on." [Hal Finney, 1994-08-21]
  16.19.8. Governments, Cyberspaces, PPLs
           - Debate periodically flares up on the List about this topic.
           - Can't be convered here in sufficient detail.
           - Friedman, Benson, Stephenson's "Snow Crash," etc.
  16.19.9. No recourse in the courts with crypto-mediated systems
           - insulated from the courts
           - PPLs are essential
           - reputations, escrow, mediation (crypto-mediated mediation?)
 16.19.10. Fraud
           - not exactly rare in the non-crypto world!
           - new flavors of cons will likely arise
           - anonymous escrow accounts, debate with Hal Finney on this
              issue, etc.
 16.19.11. PPLs, polycentric law

16.20. Libertaria in Cyberspace
  16.20.1. what it is
  16.20.2. parallels to Oceania, Galt's Gulch
  16.20.3. Privacy in communications alters the nature of connectivity
           - virtual communities, invisible to outsiders
           - truly a crypto cabal
           - this is what frightens the lawmakers the most...people can
              opt out of the mainstream governmental system, at least
              partly (and probably increasingly)

16.21. Cyberspace, private spaces, enforcement of rules, and technology
  16.21.1. Consider the "law" based approach
           - a discussion group that wants no men involved ("a protected
              space for womyn")
           - so they demand the civil law system enforce their rules
           - practical example: sysadmins yank accounts when
              "inappropriate posts" are made
           - the C&S case of spamming is an example
           - Note: The Net as currently constituted is fraught with
              confusion about who owns what, about what are public and
              what are private resources, and about what things are
              allowed. If Joe Blow sends Suzy Creamcheese an "unwanted"
              letter, is this "abuse" or "harassement"? Is it stealing
              Suzy's resources? (In my opinion, of course not, but I
              agree that things are confusing.)
  16.21.2. The technological approach:
           - spaces created by crypto...unbreachable walls
           + example: a mailing list with controls on membership
             - could require nomination and vouching for by others
             - presentation of some credential (signed by someone), e.g.
                of femaleness
           - pay as you go stops spamming
  16.21.3. This is a concrete example of how crypto acts as a kind of
            building material
           - and why government limitations on crypto hurt those who
              wish to protect their own spaces
           - a private mailing list is a private space, inaccessible to
              those outside
           - "There are good engineering approaches which can force data
              to behave itself.  Many of them involve cryptography.  Our
              government's restrictions on crypto limit our ability to
              build reliable computer systems.  We need strong crypto for
              basic engineering reasons." [Kent Borg, "Arguing Crypto:
              The Engineering Approach," 1994-06-29]
  16.21.4. Virtual Communities-the Use of Virtual Networks to Avoid
            Government
           - that is, alternatives to creating new countries (like the
              Minerva project)
           - the Assassin cult/sect in the mountains of Syria, Iraq,
              Afghanistan, etc. had a network of couriers in the mountain
              fastnessess
           - pirate communities, networks of trading posts and watering
              holes, exempt-if only for a few years-from the laws of the
              imperial powers
  16.21.5. These private spaces will, as technology makes them more
            "livable" (I don't mean in a full sense, so don't send me
            notes about how "you can't eat cyberspace"), become full-
            functioned "spaces" that are outside the reach of
            governments. A new frontier, untouchable by outside, coercive
            governments.
           - Vinge's "True Names" made real
  16.21.6. "Can things really develop in this "cyberspace" that so many
            of us talk about?"
           - "You can't eat cyberspace!' is the usual point made. I
              argue, however, that abstract worlds have always been with
              us, in the forms of commerce, reputations, friends, etc.
              And this will continue.
           - Some people have objected to the sometimes over-
              enthusiastic claims that economies and socities will
              flourish in computer-mediated cyberspaces. The short form
              of the objection is: "You can't eat cyberspace." Meaning,
              that profits and gains made in cyberspace must be converted
              to real world profits and gains.
           - In "Snow Crash," this was made out to be difficult...Hiro
              Protagonist was vastly wealthy in the Multiverse, but lived
              in a cargo container at LAX in the "real world." A fine
              novel, but this idea is screwy.
           + There are many ways to transfer wealth into the "real"
              world:
             + all the various money-laundering schemes
               - money in offshore accounts, accessible for vacations,
                  visits, etc.
               - phony purchase orders
               - my favorite: Cyberspace, Inc. hires one as a
                  "consultant" (IRS cannot and does not demand proof of
                  work being done, the nature of the work, one's
                  qualifications to perform the work, etc....In fact,
                  many consultants are hired "on retainer," merely to be
                  available should a need arise.)
             - information-selling
             - investments
             -
  16.21.7. Protocols for this are far from complete
           - money, identity, walls, structures
           - a lot of basic work is needed (though people will pursue it
              locally, not after the work is done...so solutions will
              likely be emergent)

16.22. Data Havens
  16.22.1. "What are data havens?"
           + Places where data can be hidden or protected against legal
              action.
             - Sterling, "Islands in the Net," 1988
           + Medical experiments, legal advice, pornography, weapons
             - reputations, lists of doctors, lawyers, rent deadbeats,
                credit records, private eyes
           - What to do about the mounting pressure to ban certain kinds
              of research?
           - One of the powerful uses of strong crypto is the creation
              of journals, web sites, mailing lists, etc., that are
              "untraceable." These are sometimes called "data havens,"
              though that term, as used by Bruce Sterling in "Islands in
              the Net" (1988), tends to suggest specific places like the
              Cayman Islands that corporations might use to store data. I
              prefer the emphasis on "cypherspace."
           - "It is worth noting that private "data havens" of all sorts
              abound, especially for financial matters, and most are not
              subject to governmental regulation....Some banks have
              research departments that are older and morecomprehensive
              than credit reporting agencies.  Favored customers can use
              them for evaluation of private deals....Large law firms
              maintain data banks that approach those of banks, and they
              grow with each case, through additions of private
              investigators paid for by successive clients....Security
              professionals, like Wackenhut and Kroll, also market the
              fruits of substantial data collections....To these add
              those of insurance, bonding, investment, financial firms
              and the like which help make or break business deals."
              [John Young, 1994-09-07]
  16.22.2. "Can there be laws about what can be done with data?"
           - Normative laws ("they shouldn't keep such records and hence
              we'll outlaw them") won't work in an era of strong crypto
              and privacy. In fact, some of us support data havens
              precisely to have records of, say, terminal diseases so
              we'll not lend money to Joe-who-has-AIDS. It may not be
              "fair" to Joe, but it's my money. (Same idea as in using
              offshore or cryptospatial data havens to bypass the
              nonsense in the "Fair Credit Reporting Act" that outlaws
              the keeping of certain kinds of facts about credit
              applicants, such as that they declared bankruptcy 10 years
              ago or that they left a string of bad debts in Germany in
              the 1970s, etc.)
  16.22.3. Underground Networks, Bootleg Research, and Information
            Smuggling
           + The Sharing of Forbidden Knowledge
             - even if the knowledge is not actually forbidden, many
                people relish the idea of trafficking in the forbidden
             + Some modern examples
               + drugs and marijuana cultivation
                 - drugs for life extension, AIDS treatments
                 - illegal drugs for recreational use
               + bootleg medical research, AIDS and cancer treatments,
                  etc.
                 - for example, self-help user groups that advise on
                    treatments, alternatives, etc.
               + lockpicking and similar security circumvention
                  techniques
                 - recall that possession of lockpicks may be illegal
                 - what about manuals? (note that most catalogs have a
                    disclaimer: "These materials are for educational
                    purposes only, ...")
               - defense-related issues: limitations on debate on
                  national security matters may result in "anonymous
                  forums"
               + BTW, recent work on crab shells and other hard shells
                  has produced even stronger armor!
                 - this might be some of the genetic research that is
                    highly classified and is sold on the anonymous nets
             + Alchemists and the search for immortality
               + theory that the "Grandfather of all cults" (my term)
                  started around 4500 B.C.
                 - in both Egypt and Babylonia/Sumeria
                 + ancestor of Gnostics, Sufis, Illuminati, etc.
                   - The Sufi mystic Gurdjieff claimed he was a member
                      of a mystical cult formed in Babylon about 4500
                      B.C.
                   - spider venom?
                 + Speculation: a group or cult oriented toward life
                    extension, toward the search for immortality-perhaps
                    a link to The Epic of Gilgamesh.
                   + The Gilgamesh legend
                     - Gilgamesh, Akkadian language stone tablets in
                        Nineveh
                     - made a journey to find Utnapishtim, survivor of
                        Babylonian flood and possessor of secret of
                        immortality (a plant that would renew youth)
                     - but Gilgamesh lost the plant to a serpent
                   + Egyptians
                     - obviously the Egyptians had a major interest in
                        life extension and/or immortality
                     + Osiris, God of Resurrection and Eternal Life
                       - also the Dark Companion of Serius (believed to
                          be a neutron star?)
                     - they devoted huge fraction of wealth to pyramids,
                        embalming, etc. (myrhh or frankincense from
                        desert city in modern Oman, discovered with
                        shuttle imaging radar)
                     + "pyramid power": role on Great Seal, as sign of
                        Illuminati, and of theories about cosmic energy,
                        geometrical shapes, etc.
                       - and recall work on numerological significance
                          of Great Pyramid dimensions
                       -
                   + Early Christianity
                     - focus on resurrection of Jesus Christ
                   + Quest for immortality is a major character
                      motivation or theme
                     + arguably for all people: via children,
                        achievements, lasting actions, or even "a good
                        life"
                       - "Living a good life is no substitute for living
                          forever"
                     - but some seek it explicitly
                     - "Million alive today will never die." (echoes of
                        past religious cults....Jehovah's Witnesses?)
               - banned by the Church (the Inquisition)
               + research, such as it was, was kept alive by secret
                  orders that communicated secretly and in code and that
                  were very selective about membership
                 - classes of membership to protect against discovery
                    (the modern spy cell system)
                 - red herrings designed to divert attention away
               + all of this fits the structure of such groups as the
                  Masons, Freemason, Illuminati, Rosicrucians, and other
                  mystical groups
                 - with members like John Dee, court astrologer to Queen
                    Elizabeth
                 + a genius writer-scientist like Goethe was probably a
                    member of this group
                   - Faust was his message of the struggle
               - with the Age of Rationalism, the mystical, mumbo-jumbo
                  aspects of alchemical research were seen to be passŽ,
                  and groups like Crowleys O.T.O.  became purely mystical
                  showmanship
               + but the need for secrecy was now in the financial
                  arena, with vast resources, corporate R & D labs, and
                  banks needed
                 - hence the role of the Morgans, Rothschilds, etc. in
                    these conspiracies
               + and modern computer networks will provide the next
                  step, the next system of research
                 - funded anonymously
                 - anonymous systems mean that researchers can publish
                    results in controversial areas (recall that
                    cryobiologists dare not mention cryonics, lest they
                    be expelled from American Cryobiology xxx)
           + Bootleg Medical Research (and Cryonics)
             + Cryonics Research and Anti-aging Treatments
               + Use of Nazi Data
                 - hypothermia experiments at Dachau
               + Anti-aging drugs and treatments
                 - fountain of youth, etc.
                 - many FDA restrictions, of course
                 - Mexico
                 + Switzerland
                   - foetal calf cells?
                   - blood changing or recycling?
               + Illegal Experiments
                 - reports that hyperbaric oxygen may help revival of
                    patients from neat-death in freezing accidents
             + Black Markets in Drugs, Medical Treatments
               + RU-486, bans on it
                 - anti-abortion foes
                 - easy to synthesize
                 - NOW has indicated plans to distribute this drug
                    themselves, to create networks (thus creating de
                    facto allies of the libertarian-oriented users)
               + Organ Banks
                 + establishing a profit motive for organ donors
                   - may be the only way to generate enough donations,
                      even from the dead
                   - some plans are being made for such motives,
                      especially to motivate the families of dying
                      patients
                   - ethical issues
                 + what about harvesting from the still-living?
                   - libertarians would say: OK, if informed consent was
                      given
                 - the rich can go to overseas clinics
               + AIDS patients uniting via bulletin boards to share
                  treatment ideas, self-help, etc.
                 - with buying trips to Mexico and elsewhere
               - authorities will try to halt such BBSs (on what
                  grounds, if no money is changing hands?)
             + Doctors may participate in underground research networks
                to protect their own reputations and professional status
               - to evade AMA or other professional organizations and
                  their restrictive codes of ethics
               + or lawsuits and bad publicity
                 - some groups, the "Guardian Angels" of the future,
                    seek to expose those who they think are committing
                    crimes: abortionists (even though legal), etc.
               - "politically incorrect" research, such as vitamin
                  therapy, longevity research, cryonics
             -  breast implant surgery may be forced into black markets
                (and perhaps doctors who later discover evidence of such
                operations may be forced to report such operations)
           + Back Issues of Tests and Libraries of Term Papers
             - already extant, but imagine with an AMIX-like frontend?
           + Different kinds of networks will emerge, not all of them
              equally accessible
             + the equivalent of the arms and drug networks-one does not
                gain entree merely by asking around a bit
               - credibility, reputation, "making your bones"
               - these networks are not open to the casual person
           + Some Networks May Be For the Support of Overseas
              Researchers
             + who face restrictions on their research
               - e.g., countries that ban birth control may forbid
                  researchers from communication with other researchers
               + suppose U.S. researchers are threatened with
                  sanctions-loss of their licenses, censure, even
                  prosecution-if they participate in RU-486 experiments?
                 - recall the AIDS drug bootleg trials in SF, c. 1990
             - or to bypass export restrictions
             - scenario: several anonymous bulletin boards are set
                up-and then closed down by the authorities-to facillitate
                anonymous hookups (much like "anonymous FTP")
           + Groups faced with debilitating lawsuits will "go
              underground"
             - Act Up! and Earth First! have no identifiable central
                office that can be sued, shut down, etc.
             - and Operation Rescue has done the same thing
  16.22.4. Illegal Data
           - credit histories that violate some current law about
              records
           - bootleg medical research
           - stolen data (e.g., from competitors....a GDS system could
              allow remote queries of a database, almost "oracular,"
              without the stolen data being in a U.S. jurisdiction)
           - customers in the U.K or Sweden that are forbidden to
              compile data bases on individuals may choose to store the
              data offshore and then access it discreetly (another reason
              encryption and ZKIPS must be offered)
  16.22.5. "the Switzerland of data"
           - Brussells supposedly raises fewer eyebrows than
              Lichtenstein, Luxembourg, Switzerland, etc.
           - Cayman Islands, other small nations see possibilities
  16.22.6. Information markets may have to move offshore, due to
            licensing and other restrictions
           - just as stock brokers and insurance brokers are licensed,
              the government may insist that information resellers be
              licensed (pass exams, be subject to audits and regulations)

16.23. Undermining Governments--Collapse of the State
  16.23.1. "Is it legal to advocate the overthrow of governments or the
            breaking of laws?"
           - Although many Cypherpunks are not radicals, many others of
              us are, and we often advocate "collapse of governments" and
              other such things as money laundering schemes, tax evasion,
              new methods for espionage, information markets, data
              havens, etc. This rasises obvious concerns about legality.
           - First off, I have to speak mainly of U.S. issues...the laws
              of Russia or Japan or whatever may be completely different.
              Sorry for the U.S.-centric focus of this FAQ, but that's
              the way it is. The Net started here, and still is
              dominantly here, and the laws of the U.S. are being
              propagated around the world as part of the New World Order
              and the collapse of the other superpower.
           - Is it legal to advocate the replacement of a government? In
              the U.S., it's the basic political process (though cynics
              might argue that both parties represent the same governing
              philosophy). Advocating the *violent overthrow* of the U.S.
              government is apparently illegal, though I lack a cite on
              this.
           + Is it legal to advocate illegal acts in general? Certainly
              much of free speech is precisely this: arguing for drug
              use, for boycotts, etc.
             + The EFF gopher site has this on "Advocating Lawbreaking,
                Brandenburg v. Ohio. ":
               - "In the 1969 case of Brandenburg v. Ohio, the Supreme
                  Court struck down the conviction of a Ku Klux Klan
                  member under a criminal syndicalism law and established
                  a new standard: Speech may not be suppressed or
                  punished unless it is intended to produce 'imminent
                  lawless action' and it is 'likely to produce such
                  action.' Otherwise, the First Amendment protects even
                  speech that advocates violence. The Brandenburg test is
                  the law today. "
  16.23.2. Espionage and Subversion of Governments Will be
            Revolutionized by Strong Crypto
           - (I think they see what we see, too, and this is a
              motivation for the attempts to limit the use of strong
              crypto. Besides some of the more conventional reasons.)
           + Digital dead drops will revolutionize espionage
             + spies and their controllers can communicate securely,
                relatively quickly, without fear of being watched, their
                drops compromised, etc.
               - no more nooks of trees, no more chalk marks on
                  mailboxes to signal a drop to be made
             + this must be freaking out the intelligence community!
               - more insights into why the opposition to crypto is so
                  strong
           + Cell-Based Systems and Conventional Protection Systems
             + Cells are a standard way to limit the damage of exposure
               - the standard is the 3-person cell so common in the
                  early days of Soviet espionage in the U.S.
               - but computer systems may allow new kinds of cells, with
                  more complicated protocols and more security
             + Keeping files for protection is another standard
                protection method
               + and with strong crypto, these files can be kept
                  encrypted and in locations not apparent (e.g., posted
                  on bulletin boards or other such places, with only the
                  key needed at a later time to open them)
                 - a la the "binary files" idea, wherein encrypted files
                    are widely available for some time before the key is
                    distributed (thus making it very hard for governments
                    to halt the distribution of the raw files)
  16.23.3. "Xth Column" (X = encrypted)
           - The possible need to use strong cryptography as a tool to
              fight the state.
           + helping to undermine the state by using whistleblowers and
              anonymous information markets to leak information
             - the 63,451 people given false identities in the WitSec
                program...leak their names, watch them be zapped by
                vengeful enemies, and watch the government squirm
             - auction off the details of the 1967 Inspector General's
                report on CIA assassinations
  16.23.4. use of clandestine, cell-based systems may allow a small
            group to use "termite" methods to undermine a society, to
            destroy a state that has become too repressive (sounds like
            the U.S. to me)
           - encrypted systems, anonymous pools, etc., allow truly
              secure cell-based systems (this is, by the way, one of the
              concerns many countries have about "allowing" cryptography
              to be used...and they're right abou the danger!)
           - subversion of fascist or socialist governments, undermining
              the so-called democratic governments
  16.23.5. "Why won't government simply ban  such encryption methods?"
           + This has always been the Number One Issue!
             - raised by Stiegler, Drexler, Salin, and several others
                (and in fact raised by some as an objection to my even
                discussing these issues, namely, that action may then be
                taken to head off the world I describe)
           + Types of Bans on Encryption and Secrecy
             - Ban on Private Use of Encryption
             - Ban on Store-and-Forward Nodes
             - Ban on Tokens and ZKIPS Authentication
             - Requirement for public disclosure of all transactions
             + Recent news (3-6-92, same day as Michaelangelo and
                Lawnmower Man) that government is proposing a surcharge
                on telcos and long distance services to pay for new
                equipment needed to tap phones!
               - S.266 and related bills
               - this was argued in terms of stopping drug dealers and
                  other criminals
               - but how does the government intend to deal with the
                  various forms fo end-user encryption or "confusion"
                  (the confusion that will come from compression,
                  packetizing, simple file encryption, etc.)
           + Types of Arguments Against Such Bans
             - The "Constitutional Rights" Arguments
             + The "It's Too Late" Arguments
               - PCs are already widely scattered, running dozens of
                  compression and encryption programs...it is far too
                  late to insist on "in the clear" broadcasts, whatever
                  those may be (is program code distinguishable from
                  encrypted messages? No.)
               - encrypted faxes, modem scramblers (albeit with some
                  restrictions)
               - wireless LANs, packets, radio, IR, compressed text and
                  images, etc....all will defeat any efforts short of
                  police state intervention (which may still happen)
             + The "Feud Within the NSA" Arguments
               - COMSEC vs. PROD
             + Will affect the privacy rights of corporations
               - and there is much evidence that corporations are in
                  fact being spied upon, by foreign governments, by the
                  NSA, etc.
           + They Will Try to Ban Such Encryption Techniques
             + Stings (perhaps using viruses and logic bombs)
               - or "barium," to trace the code
             + Legal liability for companies that allow employees to use
                such methods
               - perhaps even in their own time, via the assumption that
                  employees who use illegal software methods in their own
                  time are perhaps couriers or agents for their
                  corporations (a tenuous point)
  16.23.6. "How will the masses be converted?"
           - Probably they won't. Things will just happen, just as the
              masses were not converted on issues of world financial
              markets, derivative instruments, and a lot of similar
              things.
           - Crypto anarchy is largely a personal approach of
              withdrawal, of avoidance. Mass consensus is not needed
              (unless the police state option is tried).
           - Don't think in terms of selling crypto anarchy to Joe
              Average. Just use it.
  16.23.7. As things seem to be getting worse, vis-a-vis the creation of
            a police state in the U.S.--it may be a good thing that
            anonymous assassination markets will be  possible. It may
            help to level the playing field, as the Feds have had their
            hit teams for many years (along with their safe houses,
            forged credentials, accommodation addresses, cut-outs, and
            other accouterments of the intelligence state).
           - (I won't get into conspiracies here, but the following
              terms may trigger some memories: Gehlen Org, Wackenhut,
              McKee Team, Danny Casolaro, Cabazon Indians, Gander crash,
              Iraq arms deals, Pan Am 103, Bridegrooms of Death, French
              Connection, Fascist Third Position, Phoenix Program, Bebe
              Rebozo, Marex, Otto Skorzeny, Nixon, P-2, Klaus Barbie,
              etc.)
           - Plenty of evidence of misbehavior on a massive scales by
              the intelligence agencies, the police forces, and states in
              general. Absolute power has corrupted absolutely.
           - I'm certainly not advocating the killing of Congressrodents
              and other bureaucrats, just noting that this cloud may have
              a silver lining.

16.24. Escrow Agents and Reputations
  16.24.1. Escrow Agents as a way to deal with contract renegging
           - On-line clearing has the possible danger implicit in all
              trades that Alice will hand over the money, Bob will verify
              that it has cleared into hisaccount (in older terms, Bob
              would await word that his Swiss bank account has just been
              credited), and then Bob will fail to complete his end of
              the bargain. If the transaction is truly anonymous, over
              computer lines, then of course Bob just hangs up his modem
              and the connection is broken. This situation is as old as
              time, and has always involved protcols in which trust,
              repeat business, etc., are factors. Or escrow agents.
           - Long before the "key escrow" of Clipper, true escrow was
              planned. Escrow as in escrow agents. Or bonding agents.
           - Alice and Bob want to conduct a transaction. Neither trusts
              the other;
              indeed, they are unknown to each other. In steps "Esther's
              Escrow Service." She is _also utraceable_, but has
              established a digitally-signed presence and a good
              reputation for fairness. Her business is in being an escrow
              agent, like a bonding agency, not in "burning" either
              party. (The math of this is interesting: as long as the
              profits to be gained from any small set of transactions is
              less than her "reputation capital," it is in her interest
              to forego the profits from burning and be honest. It is
              also possible to arrange that Esther cannot profit from
              burning either Alice or Bob or both of them, e.g., by
              suitably encrypting the escrowed stuff.)
           - Alice can put her part of the transaction into escrow with
              Esther, Bob can do the same, and then Esther can release
              the items to the parties when conditions are met, when both
              parties agree, when adjudication of some sort occurs, etc.
              (There a dozen issues here, of course, about how disputes
              are settled, about how parties satisfy themselves that
              Esther has the items she says she has, etc.)
  16.24.2. Use of escrow services as a substute for government
           + as in underworld deals, international deals, etc.
             - "Machinery of Freedom" (Friedman), "The Enterprise of
                Law" (Benson)
           - "It is important to note in any case that the use of third-
              party escrow as a substitute for Government regulation was
              a feature of the Northern European semi-anarchies of
              Iceland and Ireland that have informed modern libertarian
              thought." [Duncan Frissell, 1994-08-30]
  16.24.3. Several people have raised the issue of someone in an
            anonymous transaction simply taking the money and not
            performing the service (or the flip side). This is where
            _intermediaries_ come into the picture, just as in the real
            worl (bonds, escrow agents, etc.).
  16.24.4. Alice and Bob wish to conduct an anonymous transaction; each
            is unknown to the other (no physical knowledge, no pseudonym
            reputation knowledge). These "mutually suspicious agents," in
            1960s- and 70s-era computer science lingo, must arrange
            methods to conduct business while not trusting the other.
  16.24.5. Various cryptographic protocols have been developed for such
            things as "bit commitment" (useful in playing poker over the
            phone, for example). I don't know of progress made at the
            granularity of anonymous transactions, though. (Though the
            cryptographic protocol building blocks at lower levels--such
            as bit commitment and blobs--will presumably be used
            eventually at higher levels, in markets.)
  16.24.6. I believe there is evidence we can shorten the cycle by
            borrowing noncryptographic protocols (heresy to purists!) and
            adapting them. Reputations, for example. And escrow agents (a
            form of reputation, in that the "value" of a bonding entity
            or escrow agent lies in reputation capital).
  16.24.7. if a single escrow agent is suspected of being untrustworthy
            (in a reputation capital sense), then can use _multiple_
            escrows
           - with various protocols, caveat emptor
           - n-out-of-m voting schemes, where n escrow agents out of m
              are required to complete a transaction
           - hard to compromise them all, especially if they have no
              idea whether they are being "legitimately bribed" or merely
              pinged by a reputation-rating service
           - Hunch: the work of Chaum, Bos, and the Pfaltzmanns on DC-
              nets may be direcly applicable here...issues of collusion,
              sets of colluders, detection of collusion, etc.

16.25. Predictions vs. Implications
  16.25.1. "How do we know that crypto anarchy will 'work,' that the
            right institutions will emerge, that wrongs will be righted,
            etc.?"
           - We don't know. Few things are certain. Only time will tell.
              These are emergent situations, where evolution will
              determine the outcome. As in other areas, the forms of
              solutions will take time to evolve.
           - (The Founders could not have predicted the form corporate
              law would take, as but one example.)
  16.25.2. My thinking on crypto anarchy is not so much _prediction_ as
            examination of trends and the implications of certain things.
            Just as steel girders mean certain things for the design of
            buildings, so too does unbreakable crypto mean certain things
            for the design of social and economic systems.
  16.25.3. Several technologies are involved:
           - Unbreakable crypto
           - Untraceable communication
           - Unforgeable signatures
  16.25.4. (Note: Yes, it's sometimes dangerous to say "unbreakable,"
            "untraceable," and "unforgeable." Purists eschew such terms.
            All crypto is economics, even information-theoretically
            secure crypto (e.g., bribe someone to give you the key, break
            in and steal it, etc.). And computationally-secure crypto--
            such as RSA, IDEA, etc.--can in *principle* be brute-forced.
            In reality,  the costs may well be exhorbitantly
            high...perhaps more energy than is available in the entire
            universe would be needed. Essentially, these things are about
            as unbreakable, untraceable, and unforgeable as one can
            imagine.)
  16.25.5. "Strong building materials" implies certain things. Highways,
            bridges, jet engines, etc. Likewise for strong crypto, though
            the exact form of the things that get built is still unknown.
            But pretty clearly some amazing new structures will be built
            this way.
  16.25.6. Cyberspace, walls, bricks and mortar...
  16.25.7. "Will strong crypto have the main effect of securing current
            freedoms, or will it create new freedoms and new situations?"
           - There's a camp that believe mainly that strong crypto will
              ensure that current freedoms are preserved, but that this
              will not change things materially, Communications can be
              private, diaries can be secured, computer security will be
              enhanced, etc.
           - Another camp--of which I am a vocal spokesman--believes
              that qualitatively different types of transactions will be
              made possible. In addition, of course, to the securing of
              liberties that the first camp things is the main effect.
           + These effects are specultative, but probably include:
             - increased hiding of assets through untraceable banking
                systems
             - markets in illegal services
             - increased espionage
             - data havens
  16.25.8. "Will all crypto-anarchic transactions be anonymous?"
           - No, various parties will negotiate different arrangements.
              All a matter of economics, of enforcement of terms, etc.
              Some will, some won't. The key thing is that the decision
              to reveal identity will be just another mutually negotiated
              matter. (Think of spending cash in a store. The store owner
              may _want_ to know who his customers are, but he'll still
              take cash and remain ignorant in most cases. Unless a
              government steps in and distorts the market by requiring
              approvals for purchases and records of identities--think of
              guns here.)
           - For example, the local Mob may not lend me money if I am
              anonymous to them, but they have a "hook" in me if they
              know who I am. (Aspects of anonymity may still be used,
              such as systems that leave no paper or computer trail
              pointing to them or to me, to avoid stings.)
           - "Enforcement" in underground markets, for which the
              conventional legal remedies are impossible, is often by
              means of physical force: breaking legs and even killing
              welshers.
           - (Personally, I have no problems with this. The Mob cannot
              turn to the local police, so it has to enforce deals its
              own way. If you can't pay, don't play.)

16.26. How Crypto Anarchy Will Be Fought
  16.26.1. The Direct Attack: Restrictions on Encryption
           + "Why won't government simply ban  such encryption methods?"
             + This has always been the Number One Issue!
               - raised by Stiegler, Drexler, Salin, and several others
                  (and in fact raised by some as an objection to my even
                  discussing these issues, namely, that action may then
                  be taken to head off the world I describe)
             + Types of Bans on Encryption and Secrecy
               - Ban on Private Use of Encryption
               - Ban on Store-and-Forward Nodes
               - Ban on Tokens and ZKIPS Authentication
               - Requirement for public disclosure of all transactions
               + Recent news (3-6-92, same day as Michaelangelo and
                  Lawnmower Man) that government is proposing a surcharge
                  on telcos and long distance services to pay for new
                  equipment needed to tap phones!
                 - S.266 and related bills
                 - this was argued in terms of stopping drug dealers and
                    other criminals
                 - but how does the government intend to deal with the
                    various forms fo end-user encryption or "confusion"
                    (the confusion that will come from compression,
                    packetizing, simple file encryption, etc.)
             + Types of Arguments Against Such Bans
               - The "Constitutional Rights" Arguments
               + The "It's Too Late" Arguments
                 - PCs are already widely scattered, running dozens of
                    compression and encryption programs...it is far too
                    late to insist on "in the clear" broadcasts, whatever
                    those may be (is program code distinguishable from
                    encrypted messages? No.)
                 - encrypted faxes, modem scramblers (albeit with some
                    restrictions)
                 - wireless LANs, packets, radio, IR, compressed text
                    and images, etc....all will defeat any efforts short
                    of police state intervention (which may still happen)
               + The "Feud Within the NSA" Arguments
                 - COMSEC vs. PROD
               + Will affect the privacy rights of corporations
                 - and there is much evidence that corporations are in
                    fact being spied upon, by foreign governments, by the
                    NSA, etc.
             + They Will Try to Ban Such Encryption Techniques
               + Stings (perhaps using viruses and logic bombs)
                 - or "barium," to trace the code
               + Legal liability for companies that allow employees to
                  use such methods
                 - perhaps even in their own time, via the assumption
                    that employees who use illegal software methods in
                    their own time are perhaps couriers or agents for
                    their corporations (a tenuous point)
           - restrictions on: use of codes and ciphers
           + there have long been certain restrictions on the use of
              encryption
             - encryption over radio waves is illegal (unless the key is
                provided to the government, as with Morse code)
             + in war time, many restrictions (by all governments)
               - those who encrypt are ipso facto guilty and are shot
                  summarily, in many places
             - even today, use of encryption near a military base or
                within a defense contractor could violate laws
           + S.266 and similar bills to mandate "trapdoors"
             + except that this will be difficult to police and even to
                detect
               - so many ways to hide messages
               - so much ordinary compression, checksumming, etc.
           + Key Registration Trail Balloon
             - cite Denning's proposal, and my own postings
  16.26.2. Another Direct Attack: Elimination of Cash
           + the idea being that elimination of cash, with credit cards
              replacing cash, will reduce black markets
             - "one person, one ID" (goal of many international
                standards organizations)
           - this elimination of cash may ultimately be tied in to the
              key registration ideas...government becomes a third party
              in all transactions
           + a favorite of conspiracy theorists
             - in extreme form: the number of the Beast tattooed on us
                (credit numbers, etc.)
             - currency exchanges (rumors on the Nets about the imminent
                recall of banknotes, ostensibly to flush out ill-gotten
                gains and make counterfeiting easier)
             + but also something governments like to do at times, sort
                of to remind us who's really in charge
               - Germany, a couple of times
               - France, in the late 1950s
               - various other devaluations and currency reforms
           + Partial steps have already been made
             - cash transactions greater than some value-$10,000 at this
                time, though "suspicious" sub-$10K transactions must be
                reported-are banned
             + large denomination bills have been withdrawn from
                circulation
               - used in drug deals, the argument goes
             - Massachussetts has demanded that banks turn over all
                account records, SS numbers, balances, etc.
           + "If what you're doing is legal, why do you need cash for
              it?"
             - part of the old American dichotomy: privacy versus "What
                have you got to hide?"
           + But why the outlawing of cash won't work
             + if a need exists, black markets will arise
               - i.e., the normal tradeoff between risk and reward:
                  there may be some "discounts" on the value, but cah
                  will still circulate
             + too many other channels exist: securities, secrets, goods
               + from trading in gold or silver, neither of which are
                  outlawed any longer, to trading in secrets, how can the
                  government stop this?
                 - art being used to transfer money across international
                    borders (avoids Customs)
                 - "consideration" given, a la the scam to hide income
               + total surveillance?
                 - it doesn't even work in Russia
                 - on the other hand, Russia lacks the "point of sale"
                    infrastructure to enforce a cashless system
  16.26.3. Another Direct Attack: Government Control of Encryption,
            Networks,  and Net Access
           - a la the old Bell System monopoly, which limited what could
              be hooked up to a phone line
           + the government may take control of the networks in several
              ways:
             + FCC-type restrictions, though it is hard to see how a
                private network, on private property, could be restricted
               - as it is not using part of the "public spectrum"
               - but it is hard to build a very interesting network that
                  stays on private property....and as soon as it crosses
                  public property, BINGO!
             + "National Data Highway" could be so heavily subsidized
                that alternatives will languish (for a while)
               - the Al Gore proposals for a federally funded system
                  (and his wife, Tipper, is of course a leader of the
                  censorship wing)
               - and then the government can claim the right and duty to
                  set the "traffic" laws: protocols, types of encryption
                  allowed, etc.
             - key patents, a la RSA (if in fact gov't.  is a silent
                partner in RSA Data Security)
  16.26.4. An Indirect Attack: Insisting that all  economic transactions
            be "disclosed" (the "Full Disclosure Society" scenario)
           + this sounds Orwellian, but the obvious precedent is that
              businesses must keep records of all financial transactions
              (and even some other records, to see if they're colluding
              or manipulating something)
             - for income and sales tax reasons
             - and OSHA inspections, INS raids, etc.
             + there is currently no requirement that all transactions
                be fully documented with the identies of all parties,
                except in some cases like firearms purchases, but this
                could change
               - especially as electronic transactions become more
                  common: the IRS may someday insist on such records,
                  perhaps even insisting on escrowing of such records, or
                  time-stamping
               + this will hurt small businesses, due to the entry cost
                  and overhead of such systems, but big businesses will
                  probably support it (after some grumbling)
                 - big business always sees bureaucracy as one of their
                    competitive advantages
             + and individuals have not been hassled by the IRS on minor
                personal transactions, though the web is tightening:
                1099s are often required (when payments exceed some
                amount, such as $500)
               - small scale barter transactions
           + but the nature of CA is that many transactions can be
              financial while appearing to be something else (like the
              transfer of music or images, or even the writing of
              letters)
             - which is why a cusp is coming: full disclosure is one
                route, protection of privacy is another
           + the government may cite the dangers of a "good old boy
              network" (literally) that promulgates racist, sexist, and
              ableist discrimination via computer networks
             - i.e., that the new networks are "under-representing
                people of color"
             - and how can quotas be enforced in an anonymous system?
           - proposals in California (7-92) that consultants file
              monthly tax statements, have tax witheld, etc.
           - a strategy for the IRS: require all computer network users
              to have a "taxpayer ID number" for all transactions, so
              that tax evasion can be checked
  16.26.5. Attempts to discredit reputation-based systems by deceit,
            fraud, nonpayment, etc.
           - deliberate attacks on the reputation of services the
              government doesn't want to see
           - there may be government operations to sabotage  businesses,
              to undermine such efforts before they get started
           - analogous to "mail-bombing" an anonymous remailer
  16.26.6. Licensing of software developers may be one method used to
            try to control the spread of anonymous systems and
            information markets
           - by requiring a "business license" attached to any and all
              chunks of code
           + implemented via digital signatures, a la the code signing
              protocols mentioned by Bob Baldwin as a means of reducing
              trapdoors, sabotage, and other modifications by spies,
              hackers, etc.
             - proposals to require all chunks of code to be signed,
                after the Sililcon Valley case in mid-80s, where
                spy/saboteur went to several s/w companies and meddled
                with code
           - "seals" from some group such as "Software Writers
              Laboratories," with formal specs required, source code
              provided to a trusted keeper, etc.
           + such licensing and inspection will also serve to lock-in
              the current players (Microsoft will love it) and make
              foreign competition in software more difficult
             - unless the foreign competition is "sanctioned," e.g.,
                Microsoft opens a code facility in India
  16.26.7. RICO-like seizures of computers and bulletin board systems
           - sting operations and setups
           - Steve Jackson Games is obvious example
           - for illegal material (porno, drug advocacy, electronic
              money, etc.) flowing through their systems
           - even when sysop can prove he did not know illegal acts were
              being committed on his system (precedents are the yachts
              seized because a roach was found)
           + these seizures can occur even when a trial is never held
             - e.g., the "administrative seizure" of cars in Portland in
                prostitution cases
             - and the seizures are on civil penalties, where the
                standards of proof are much lower
           + in some cases a mere FBI investigation is enough to get
              employees fired, renters kicked out, IRS audits started
             + reports that a woman in Georgia who posted some "ULs"
                (unlisted numbers?) was fired by her company after the
                FBI got involved, told by her landlord that her lease was
                not being extended, and so forth
               - "We don't truck with no spies"
             - the IRS audit would not ostensibly be for harassment, but
                for "probable cause" (or whatever term they use) that tax
                avoidance, under-reporting, even money-laundering might
                be involved
  16.26.8. Outlawing of Digital Pseudonyms and Credentialling
           + may echoe the misguided controversy over Caller ID
             - misguided because the free market solution is clear: let
                those who wish to hide their numbers-rape and battering
                support numbers, police, detectives, or even just
                citizens requesting services or whatever-do so
             - and let those who refuse to deal with these anonymous
                callers also do so (a simple enough programming of
                answering machines and telephones)
           - for example, to prevent minors and felons from using the
              systems, "true names" may be required, with heavy fines and
              forfeitures of equipment and assets for anybody that fails
              to comply (or is caught in stings and setups)
           + minors may get screened out of parts of cyberspace by
              mandatory "age credentialing" ("carding")
             - this could be a major threat to such free and open
                systems, as with the various flaps over minors logging on
                to the Internet and seeing X-rated images (however poorly
                rendered) or reading salacious material in alt.sex
             - there may be some government mood to insist that only
                "true names" be used, to facillitate such age screening
                (Fiat-Shamir passports, papers, number of the Beast?)
           + the government may argue that digital pseudonyms are
              presumptively considered to be part of a conspiracy, a
              criminal enterprise, tax evasion, etc.
             - the old "what have you got to hide" theory
             - closely related to the issue of whether false IDs can be
                used even when no crimes are being committed (that is,
                can Joe Average represent himself by other than his True
                Name?)
           - civil libertarians may fight this ban, arguing that
              Americans are not required to present "papers" to
              authorities unless under direct suspicion for a crime
              (never mind the loitering laws, which take the other view)
  16.26.9. Anonymous systems may be restricted on the grounds that they
            constitute a public nuisance
           - or that they promote crime, espionage, etc.
           + especially after a few well-publicized abuses
             - possibly instigated by the government?
           - operators may have to post bonds that effectively drive
              them out of business
 16.26.10. Corporations may be effectively forbidden to hire consultants
            or subcontractors as individuals
           + the practical issue: the welter of tax and benefit laws
              make individuals unable to cope with the mountains of forms
              that have to be filed
             - thus effectively pricing individuals out of this market
           + the tax law side: recall the change in status of
              consultants a few years back...this may be extended further
             - a strategy for the IRS: require all computer network
                users to have a "taxpayer ID number" for all
                transactions, so that tax evasion can be checked
             - not clear how this differs from the point above, but I
                feel certain more such pressures will be applied (after
                all, most corporations tend to see independent
                contractors as more of a negative than a positive)
           - this may be an agenda of the already established companies:
              they see consultants and free lancers as thieves and
              knaves, stealing their secrets and disseminating the crown
              jewels (to punningly mix some metaphors)
           - and since the networks discussed here facilitate the use of
              consultants, more grounds to limit them
 16.26.11. There may be calls for U.N. control of the world banking
            system in the wake of the BCCI and similar scandals
           - to "peirce the veil" on transnationals
           - calls for an end to banking secrecy
           - talk about denying access to the money centers of New York
              (but will this push the business offshore, in parallel to
              the Eurodollar market?)
           + motivations and methods
             - recall the UNESCO attempt a few years back to credential
                reporters, ostensibly to prevent chaos and "unfair"
                reporting...well, the BCCI and nuclear arms deals
                surfacing may reinvigorate the efforts of
                "credentiallers"
             + the USSR and other countries entering the world community
                may sense an opportunity to get in on the formation of
                "boards of directors" of these kinds of banks and
                corporations and so may push the idea in the U.N.
               - sort of like a World Bank or IMF with even more power
                  to step in and take control of other banks, and with
                  the East Bloc and USSR having seats!
 16.26.12. "National security"
           - if the situation gets serious enough, a la a full-blown
              crypto anarchy system, mightn't the government take the
              step of declaring a kind of national emergency?
           - provisions exist: "401 Emergency" and FEMA plans
           - of course, the USSR tried to intitiate emergency measures
              and failed
           - recall that a major goal of crypto anarchy is that the
              systems described here will be so widely deployed as to be
              essential or critical to the overall economy...any attempt
              to "pull the plug" will also kill the economy
 16.26.13. Can authorities force the disclosure of a key?
           + on the "Yes" side:
             + is same, some say,  as forcing combination to a safe
                containing information or stolen goods
               - but some say-and a court may have ruled on this-that
                  the safe can always be cut open and so the issue is
                  mostly moot
               - while forcing key disclosure is compelled testimony
             - and one can always claim to have forgotten the key
             - i.e., what happens when a suspect simply clams up?
             - but authorities can routinely demand cooperation in
                investigations, can seize records, etc.
           + on the "No" side:
             - can't force a suspect to talk, whether about where he hid
                the loot or where his kidnap victim is hidden
             - practically speaking, someone under indictment cannot be
                forced to reveal Swiss bank accounts....this would seem
                to be directly analogous to a cryptographic key
             - thus, the key to open an account would seem to be the
                same thing
             - a memorized key cannot be forced, says someone with EFF
                or CPSR
           - on balance, it seems clear that the disclosure of
              cryptographic keys cannot be forced (though the practical
              penalty for nondisclosure could be severe)
           - but this has not really been tested, so far as I know
           - and many people say that such cooperation can be
              demanded...

16.27. How Crypto Anarchy Advocates Will Fight Back
  16.27.1. Bypassing restrictions on commercial encryption packages by
            not making them "commercial"
           - public domain
           - freely distributed
           - after all, the basic algorithms are simple and don't really
              deserve patent protection: money will not be made by the
              originators of the code, but by the actual providers of
              services (for transmission and storage of packets)
  16.27.2. Noise and signals are often indistinguishable
           - as with the LSB audio signal approach...unless the
              government outlaws live recordings or dubs on digital
              systems...
  16.27.3. Timed-release files (using encryption) will be used to hide
            files, to ensure that governments cannot remove material they
            don't like
           - easier said than done
  16.27.4. Legal approaches will also be taken: fundamental
            constitutional issues
           - privacy, free speech, free association
  16.27.5. The Master Plan to Fight Restrictions on Encryption
           + "Genie out of the bottle" strategy: deploy crypto widely
             - intertwined with religions, games, whistleblower groups,
                and other uses that cannot easily just be shut down
             - scattered in amongst many other activities
           - Media attention: get media to report on value of
              encryption, privacy, etc.
           + Diffusion, confusion, and refusion
             - Diffuse the use by scattering it around
             - Confuse the issue by fake religions, games, other uses
             - Refuse to cooperate with the government
           - Free speech arguments: calling the discussions free speech
              and forcing the government to prove that the free speech is
              actually an economic transaction
           + links with religions, corporations, etc.
             - private meetings protected
             - voting systems

16.28. Things that May Hide the Existence of Crypto Anarchy
  16.28.1. first and foremost, the incredible bandwidth, the bits
            sloshing around the world's networks...tapes being exchanged,
            PCs calling other PCs, a variety of data and compression
            formats, ISDN, wireless transmission, etc.
  16.28.2. in the coming years, network traffic will jump a thousand-
            fold, what with digital fax, cellular phones and computers,
            ISDN, fiber optics, and higher-speed modems
           - and these links will be of all kinds: local, private,
              corporate, business, commercial, bootleg (unrecorded),
              cellular radio, etc.
  16.28.3. corporations and small groups will have their own private
            LANs and networks, with massive bandwidth, and with little
            prospects that the government can police them-there can be no
            law requiring that internal communications be readable by the
            government!
           - and the revelations that Ultra Black has been used to read
              messages and use the information will be further proof to
              corporations that they need to adopt very strong security
              measures
           + and "partnerships" can be scattered across the country, and
              even internationally, and have great lattitude in setting
              up their own communication and encryption systems
             - recall Cargill case
             - and also remember that the government may crack down on
                these systems
  16.28.4. AMIX-like services, new services, virtual reality (for games,
            entertainment, or just as a place of doing business) etc.
           + many users will encrypt their links to VR servers, with a
              decryption agent at the other end, so that their activities
              (characters, fantasies, purchases, etc.) cannot be
              monitored and logged
             + this will further increase the bandwidth of encrypted
                data and will complicate further the work of the NSA and
                similar agencies
               - attempts to force "in the clear" links will be doomed
                  by the welter of PC standards, compression utilities,
                  cellular modems, and the like...there will be no
                  "cleartext" that can be mandated
  16.28.5. steganography
           + in general, impossible to know that a message contains
              other encypted messages
             - except in stings and setups, which may be ruled illegal
           + the LSB method, and variants
             + LSB of DAT, DCC, MD, etc., or even sound bites (chunks of
                sampled sounds traded on bulletin boards)
               - especially of live or analog-dubbed copies (the noise
                  floor of a typical consumer-grade mike is much higher
                  than the LSB of DAT)
             + of images, Adobe Photoshop images, artwork, etc.
               + imagine an "Online Art Gallery" that is used to store
                  messages, or a "Photo Gallery" that participants post
                  their best photos to, offering them for sale
                 - Sturges case
                 - LSB method
             + gets into some theoretical nitpicking about the true
                nature of noise, especially if the entire LSB channel is
                uncharacteristic of "real noise"
               - but by reducing the bandwidth somewhat, the noise
                  profile can be made essentially undistinguishable from
                  real noise
               - and a 2 GB DAT produces 130 MB of LSB, which is a lot
                  of margin!
             + what could the government do?
               - stings and setups to catch and scare off potential
                  users
               - an attempt to limit the wide use of digital
                  data-hopeless!
               + a requirement for government-approved "dithering"?
                 - this would be an enforcement nightmare
                 + and would only cause the system to be moved into
                    higher bits
                   - and with enough error correction, even audible
                      dithering of the signal would not wipe out the
                      encrypted signal
             + variants: text justification, word selection
               - bandwidth tends to be low
               - but used in Three Days of the Condor
           + virtual reality art may further enable private
              communications
             - think of what can be encrypted into such digital images!
             - and user has total privacy and is able to manipulate the
                images and databases locally
  16.28.6. in the sense that these other things, such as the governments
            own networks of safe houses, false identities, and bootleg
            payoffs, will tend to hide any other such systems that emerge
           + because investigators may think they've stumbled onto yet
              another intelligence operation, or sting, or whatever
             - this routinely cripples undercover investigations
             - scenario: criminals even float rumors that another agency
                is doing an operation....?
  16.28.7. Government Operations that Resemble Cryptoanarchy will
            Confuse the Issues
           - various confidential networks already exist, operated by
              State, DoD, the services, etc.
           + Witness Protection Program (or Witness Relocation Program)
             - false IDs, papers, transcripts
             - even money given to them (and the amounts seem to be
                downplayed in the press and on t.v., with a sudden spate
                of shows about how poorly they do in the middle of middle
                America-sounds like a planted story to me)
             - cooperation with certain companies and schools to assist
                in this aspect
           + Payoffs of informants, unofficial agents
             - like agents in place inside defense contractors
             - vast amount of tips from freelancers, foreign citizens,
                etc.
             - operators of safe houses (like Mrs. Furbershaw)
           + Networks of CIA-funded banks, for various purposes
             - a la the Nugan-Hand Bank, BCCI, etc.
             - First American, Bank of Atlanta, Centrust Savings, etc.
             - these banks and S&Ls act as conduits for controversial or
                secret operations, for temporary parking of funds, for
                the banking of profits, and even for the private
                retirement funds of agents (a winked-at practice)
           + Confidential networks over computer lines
             - e.g., encrypted teleconferencing of Jasons, PFIAB, etc.
             + these will increase, for many reasons
               - concerns over terrorism
               - demands on time will limit travel (especially for
                  groups of non-fulltime committee members)
           - these suspected government operations will deter
              investigation
  16.28.8. Encrypted Traffic Will Increase Dramatically
           - of all kinds
           - mail, images, proposals, faxes, etc.
           - acceptance of a P-K mail system will make wide use of
              encryption nearly automatic (though some fraction, perhaps
              the majority, will not even bother)
           + there may even be legal reasons for encryption to increase:
             - requirements that employee records be protected, that
                medical records be protected, etc.
             - "prudent man" rules about the theft of information (could
                mean that files are to be encrypted except when being
                worked on)
             - digital signatures
             - echoes of the COMSEC vs. SIGINT (or PROD) debate, where
                COMSEC wants to see more encryption (to protect American
                industry against Soviet and commercial espionage)
           + Selling of "Anonymous Mailers"?
             - using RSA
             + avoiding RSA and the P-K patent morass
               - could sell packets of one-time pads
               + no effective guarantee of security, but adequate for
                  many simple purposes
                 + especially if buyers swap them with others
                   - but how to ensure that copies are not kept?
               - idea is to enable a kind of "Democracy Wall"
             + prepaid "coins," purchased anonymously
               - as with the Japanese phone cards
               - or the various toll booth electronic tokens being
                  developed
  16.28.9. Games, Religions, Legal Consultation, and Other "Covers" for
            the Introduction and Proliferation of Crypto Anarchy
           - won't be clear what is real encryption and what is game-
              playing
           - imagine a game called "Cryptoanarchy"!
           + Comment on these "Covers"
             - some of these will be quite legitimate, others will be
                deliberately set up as covers for the spread of CA
                methods
             - perhaps subsidized just to increase traffic (and
                encrypted traffic is already expected to increase for a
                variety of reasons)
             - people will have various reasons for wanting anonymity
           + Games
             + "Habitat"-style games and systems
               - with "handles" that are much more secure than at
                  present (recall Chip's comments)
               + behaviors that are closely akin to real-world illegal
                  behaviors:
                 - a thieves area
                 - an espionage game
                 - a "democracy wall" in which anything can be posted
                    anonymously, and read by all
             + MUDs (Multi-user Domains, Multi-User Dungeons)
               - lots of interest here
               - topic of discussion at a special Cypherpunks meeting,
                  early 1994.
             + interactive role-playing games will provide cover for the
                spread of systems: pseudonyms will have much more
                protection than they now have
               - though various methods may exist to "tag" a transaction
                  (a la barium), especially when lots of bandwidth is
                  involved, for analysis (e.g., "Dark Dante" is
                  identified by attaching specific bits to stream)
               + Dealing with Barium Tracers
                 - code is allowed to simmer in an offsite machine for
                    some time (and with twiddling of system clock)
                 - mutations added
             + Shared Worlds
               - authors, artists, game-players, etc. may add to these
                  worlds
               - hypertext links, reputation-based systems
             + hypothesize a "True Names" game on the nets, based
                _explicitly_ on Vinge's work
               - perhaps from an outfit like Steve Jackson Games, maker
                  of similar role-playing games
               - with variable-resolution graphics (a la Habitat)
               - virtual reality capabilities
             + a game like "Habitat" can be used as a virtual Labyrinth,
                further confusing the line between reality and fantasy
               - and this could provide a lot of bandwidth for cover
               - the Smalltalk "Cryptoids" idea is related to this...it
                  looks like a simulation or a game, but can be used by
                  "outsiders"
           + Religions
             + a nearly ironclad system of liberties, though _some_
                limits exist
               - e.g., a church that uses its organization to transport
                  drugs or run a gambling operation would be shut down
                  quickly (recall the drug church?)
               - and calls for tax-break limitations (which Bill of
                  Rights says nothing about)
             - still, it will be _very_ difficult for the U.S.
                government to interfere with the communications of a
                "religion."
             + "ConfessionNet"
               + a hypothetical anonymous system that allows confessions
                  to be heard, with all of the privileges of privacy that
                  normal confessions have
                 - successors to 900 numbers?
               + virtually ironclad protections against government
                  interference
                 - "Congress shall make no law..."
               + but governments may try to restrict who can do this, a
                  la the restrictions in the 70s and 80s on "instant
                  Reverends"
                 - Kirby J. Hensley's Univeral Life Church
                 - various IRS restrictions, effectively establishing
                    two classes of religions: those grandfathered in and
                    given tax breaks and the like, and those that were
                    deemed invalid in some way
             + Scenario: A Scientology-like cult using CA as its chief
                communications system?
               - levels of initiation same as a cell system
               - "clearing"
               - New Age garbage: Ascended Masters, cells, money flowing
                  back and forth
               - blackballing
           + Digital Personals
             - the "personals" section of newspapers currently requires
                the newspaper to provide the anonymity (until the parties
                mutually agree to meet)
             - what about on AMIX or similar services?
             - a fully digital system could allow self-arranging systems
             + here's how it could work:
               - Alice wants to meet a man. She writes up a typical ad,
                  "SWF seeks SWM for fun and walks on the beach..."
               - Alice encloses her specially-selected public key, which
                  is effectively her only name. This is probably a one-
                  time deal, unlinkable to her in any way.
               - She encrypts the entire package and sends it through a
                  remailing chain (or DC-Net) for eventual posting in a
                  public place.
               - Everyone can download the relevant area (messages can
                  be sorted by type, or organized in interest groups),
                  with nobody else knowing which messages they're
                  reading.
               - Bob reads her message and decides to repond. He
                  digitizes a photo of himself and includes some other
                  info, but not his real name. He also picks a public key
                  for Alice to communicate with him.
               - Bob encrypts all of this with the public key of Alice
                  (though remember that he has no way of knowing who she
                  really is).
               - Bob sends this message through a remailing chain and it
                  gets posted as an encrypted message addressed to the
                  public key of Alice. Again, some organization can
                  reduce the total bandwidth (e.g., an area for
                  "Replies").
               - Alice scans the replies and downloads a group of
                  messages that includes the one she can see-and only she
                  can see!-is addressed to her.
               - This has established a two-way communication path
                  between Alice and Bob without either of them knowing
                  who the other one is or where they live. (The business
                  about the photos is of course not conducive to
                  anonymity, but is consistent with the "Personals"
                  mode.)
               - If Alice and Bob wish to meet in person it is then easy
                  for them to communicate real phone numbers and the
                  like.
             + Why is this interesting?
               - it establishes a role for anonymous systems
               - it could increase the bandwidth of such messages
           + Legal Services (Legitimate, i.e., not even the bootleg
              stuff)
             + protected by attorney-client privileges, but various Bar
                Associations may place limits on the use of networks
               - but if viewed the way phones are, seems unlikely that
                  Bars could do much to limit the use of computer
                  networks
             - and suppose a Nolo Press-type publishing venture started
                up on the Nets? (publishing self-help info under
                pseudonyms)
             - or the scam to avoid taxes by incorporating as a
                corporation or nonprofit?
           + Voting Systems
             - with and without anonymity
             + Board of Directors-type voting
               - with credentials, passwords, and (maybe) anonymity
                  (under certain conditions)
             + Blackballing and Memberships
               - generally anonymous
               - blackballing may be illegal these days (concerns about
                  racism, sexism, etc.)
               - cf. Salomaa for discussion of indistinguishability of
                  blackballing from majority voting
             + Consumer Ratings and Evaluations
               - e.g., there may be "guaranteed anonymous" evalution
                  systems for software and other high-tech items (Joe
                  Bluecollar won't mess with computers and complicated
                  voting systems)
             + Politically Active Groups May Have Anonymous Voting
               - to vote on group policies, procedures, leadership
               - or on boycott lists (recall the idea of the PC-Card
                  that doesn't allow politically incorrect purchases)
               + this may be to protect themselves from lawsuits (SLAPP)
                  and government harassment
                 - they fear government infiltrators will get the names
                    of voters and how they voted
             + Official Elections
               - though this is unlikely for the barely-literate
                  majority
               - the inevitable fraud cases will get wide exposure and
                  scare people and politicians off even more
               - unlikely in next decade
             + Journal Refereeing
               - some journals, such as Journal of Cryptology,
                  appropriately enough, are already using paper-based
                  versions of this
               + Xanadu-like systems may be early adopters
                 - there are of course reasons for just the opposite:
                    enhanced used of reputations
                 - but in some cases anonymity may be preferred
           + Groupware
             - anonymous comment systems (picture a digital blackboard
                with anonymous remarks showing up)
             - these systems are promoted to encourage the quiet to have
                an equal voice
             - but they also provide another path to anonymous and/or
                reputation-based systems
           + Psychological Consultations
             - will require the licensing of counselors, of course
                (under U.S. laws)
             - what if people call offshore counselors?
             + and various limitations on privacy of records exist
               - Tarisoff [spelling?]
               - subpoenas
               - record-keeping required
             + may be used by various "politically correct" groups
               - battered women
               - abused children
               - perhaps in conjunction with the RU-486-type issues,
                  some common ground can be established (a new kind of
                  Underground Railroad)
           + Advice on Medicine (a la AIDS, RU 486)
             - anonymity needed to protect against lawsuits and seizure
             - NOW and other feminist groups could use crypto anarchy
                methods to reduce the risks to their organizations
           + Anonymous Tip Lines, Whistleblower Services
             + for example, a newspaper might set up a reward system,
                using the crypto equivalent of the "torn paper" key
               - where informant holds onto the torn off "key"
             - even something like the James Randi/Yuri Geller case
                reveals that "anonymous critics" may become more common
             + corporate and defense contractor whistleblowers may seek
                protection through crypto methods
               - a "Deep Throat" who uses bulletin boards to communicate
                  with DS?
             + this presumes much wider use of computers and modems by
                "average" people...and I doubt "Prodigy"-type systems
                will support these activities!
               - but there may be cheap systems based on video game
                  machines, a la the proposed Nintendo computers
             - environmentalists set up these whistleblower lines, for
                people to report illegal logging, spraying, etc.
           + Online, "Instant" Corporations
             + shell companies, duly incorporated in Delaware or
                wherever (perhaps even foreign sites) are "sold" to
                participants who wish to create a corporate cover for
                their activities
               - so that AMIX-like fees are part of the "internal
                  accounting"
           + Anonymous collaborative writing and criticism
             - similar to anonymous voting
 16.28.10. Compressed traffic will similarly increase
           - and many compression algortithms will offer some form of
              encryption as a freebie
           - and will be difficult to decypher, based just on sheer
              volume
           - files will have to at least be decompressed before key word
              searches can be done (though there may be shortcuts)

16.29. The Coming Phase Change
  16.29.1. "We'd better hope that strong cypto, cheap telecoms and free
            markets can provide the organizing basis for a workable
            society because it is clear that coercion as an organizing
            principle ain't what it used to be."    [Duncan Frissell, in
            his sig, 4-13-94]
  16.29.2. "What is the "inevitability" argument?"
           - Often made by me (Tim May), Duncan Frissell, Sandy
              Sandfort, and Perry Metzger (with some twists). And Hal
              Finney takes issue with certain aspects and contributes
              incisive critiques.
           + Reasons:
             - borders becoming more transparent to data flow
             - encryption is not detectable/stoppable
             - derivative financial instruments, money sloshing across
                borders
             - transnationalism
             - cash machines, wire transfers
             - "permanent tourists"
           - Borders are becoming utterly transparent to massive data
              flows. The rapid export of crypto is but an ironic example
              of this. Mosaid, ftp, gopher, lynx...all cross borders
              fluidly and nearly untraceably. It is probably too late to
              stop these systems, short of "pulling the plug" on the Net,
              and this pulling the plug is simply too expensive to
              consider. (If the Feds ever really figure out the long-
              range implications of this stuff, they may try it...but
              probably not.)
  16.29.3. "What is the "crypto phase change"?"
           - I'm normally skeptical of claims that a "singularity" is
              coming (nanotechnology being the usual place this is
              claimed, a la Vinge), but "phase changes" are more
              plausible. The effect of cheap printing was one such phase
              change, altering the connectivity of society and the
              dispersion of knowledge in a way that can best be described
              as a phase change. The effects of strong crypto, and the
              related ideas of digital cash, anonymous markets, etc., are
              likely to be similar.
           - transition
           - tipping factors, disgust by populace, runaway taxation
           + "leverage effect"
             - what Kelly called "the fax effect"
             - crypto use spreads, made more popular by common use
           - can nucleate in a small group...doesn't need mass
              acceptance
  16.29.4. "Can crypto anarchy be stopped?"
           + A goal is to get crypto widely enough deployed that it
              cannot then be stopped
             - to the point of no return, where the cost of withdrawing
                or banning a technology is simply too high (not always a
                guaranteee)
           - The only recourse is a police state in which homes and
              businesses are randomly entered and searched, in which
              cryptography is outlawed and vigorously prosecuted, in
              which wiretaps, video surveillance, and other forms of
              surveillance are used aggressively, and in which perhaps
              the very possession of computers and modems is restricted.
           - Anything short of these police state tactics will allow the
              development of the ideas discussed here. To some extent.
              But enough to trigger the transition to a mostly crypto
              anarchic situation.
           - (This doesn't mean everyone, or even most, will use crypto
              anarchy.)
  16.29.5. Need not be a universal or even popular trend
           - even if restricted to a minority, can be very influential
           - George Soros, Quantum fund, central banks, Spain, Britain,
              Germany
           - and a minority trend can affect others
  16.29.6. "National borders are just speedbumps on the digital
            superhighway."
  16.29.7. "Does crypto anarchy have to be a mass movement to succeed?"
           - Given that only a tiny fraction is now aware of the
              implications....
           + Precedents for "vanguard" movements
             + high finance in general is an elite thing
               - Eurodollars, interest rate swaps, etc....not exactly
                  Joe Average...and yet of incredible importance (George
                  Soros has affected European central bank policy)
             - smuggling is in general not a mass thing
             - etc.
           + Thus, the users of crypto anarchic tools and instruments
              can have an effect out of proportion to their numbers
             - others will start to use
             - resentment by the "suckers" will build
             - the services themselves--the data havens, the credit
                registries, the espionage markets--will of course have a
                real effect
  16.29.8. Strong crypto does not mean the end to law enforcement
           - "...cryptography is not by any means a magic shield for
              criminals.  It eliminates, perhaps, one avenue by which
              crimes might be discovered.  However, it is most certainly
              not the case that someone who places an open anonymous
              contract for a murder in an open forum is doing so "risk
              free".  There are *plenty* of ways she might be found out.
              Likewise, big secret societies that nefariously undermine
              the free world via cryptography are as vulnerable as ever
              to the motivations of their own members to expose the
              groups in a double-cross." [Mike McNally, 1994-09-09]

16.30. Loose Ends
  16.30.1. governments may try to ban the use of encryption in any
            broadcast system, no matter how low the power, because of a
            realization that all of them can be used for crypto anarchy
            and espionage
           - a losing battle, of course, what with wireless LANs of
              several flavors, cellular modems, the ability to hide
              information, and just the huge increase in bandwidth
  16.30.2. "tontines"
           - Eric Hughes wrote up some stuff on this in 1992 [try to get
              it]
           - Italian pseudo-insurance arrangements
           - "digital tontines"?
  16.30.3. Even in market anarchies, there are times when a top-down,
            enforced set of behaviors is desirable. However, instead of
            being enforced by threat of violence, the market itself
            enforces a standard.
           - For example, the Macintosh OS, with standardized commands
              that program developers are "encouraged" to use. Deviations
              are obviously allowed, but the market tends to punish such
              deviations. (This has been useful in avoiding modal
              software, where the same keystroke sequence might save a
              file in one program and erase it in another. Sadly, the
              complexity of modern software has outpaced the Mac OS
              system, so that Command-Option Y often does different
              things in different programs.)
           - Market standards are a noncoercive counter to total chaos.
  16.30.4. Of course, nothing stops people from hiring financial
            advisors, lawyers, and even "Protectors" to shield them from
            the predations of others. Widows and orphans could choose
            conservative conservators, while young turks could choose to
            go it alone.
  16.30.5. on who can tolerate crypto anarchy
           - Not much different here from how things have been in the
              past. Caveat emptor. Look out for Number One. Beware of
              snake oil.
  16.30.6. Local enforcement of rules rather than global rules
           + e.g., flooding of Usenet with advertising and chain letters
             + two main approaches
               - ban such things, or set quotas, global acceptable use
                  policies, etc. (or use tort law to prosecute & collect
                  damages)
               - local carrriers decide what they will and will not
                  carry, and how much they'll charge
             - it's the old rationing vs. market pricing argument
  16.30.7. Locality is a powerful concept
           - self-responsibility
           - who better to make decisions than those affected?
           - tighter feedback loops
           - avoids large-scale governments
           + Nonlocally-arranged systems often result in calls to stop
              "hogging" of resources, and general rancor and envy
             + water consumption is the best example: anybody seen
                "wasting" water, regardless of their conservations
                elsewhere or there priorities, is chastised and rebuked.
                Sometimes the water police are called.
               - the costs involved (perhaps a few pennies worth of
                  water, to wash a car or water some roses) are often
                  trivial...meanwhile, billions of acre-feet of water are
                  sold far below cost to farmers who grow monsoon crops
                  like rice in the California desert
               - this hypocrisy is high on my list of reasons why free
                  markets are morally preferable to rationing-based
                  systems
